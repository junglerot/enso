## These tests are parametrized by various backends and so they should be run in
   context of a specific backend. However, for the purpose of testing we provide
   a shortcut that allows to run these tests with the in-memory backend.

## Adds a clue which will display the provided table next to the failed test
   description.

   > Example
     Test a property of the table, displaying its contents if the test fails.

         t = Table.new [["A", [1, 2, 3]]]
         within_table t <|
             t.at "A" . to_vector . should_equal [1, 2, 3]
