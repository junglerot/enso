## A flag reading the environment variable enabling additional benchmarks.

   These additional benchmarks are not run on CI by default, to avoid inflating
   the run-time of the CI benchmarks too much. These extra benchmarks may be
   useful to serve as a comparison of various approaches / variants of solutions
   to a problem to be able to better understand differences between the
   approaches. If they are disabled, only the core benchmarks that measure the
   most important scenarios are run.
