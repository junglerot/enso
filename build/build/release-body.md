# Anonymous Data Collection

Please note that this release collects anonymous usage data which will be used
to improve Enso and prepare it for a stable release. We will switch to opt-in
data collection in stable version releases. The usage data will not contain your
code (expressions above nodes), however, reported errors may contain brief
snippets of out of context code that specifically leads to the error, like "the
method 'foo' does not exist on Number". The following data will be collected:

- Session length.
- Graph editing events (node creation, deletion, position change, connect,
  disconnect, collapse, edit start, edit end). This will not include any
  information about node expressions used.
- Navigation events (camera movement, scope change).
- Visualization events (visualization open, close, switch). This will not
  include any information about the displayed data nor the rendered
  visualization itself.
- Project management events (project open, close, rename).
- Errors (IDE crashes, WASM panics, Project Manager errors, Language Server
  errors, Compiler errors).
- Performance statistics (minimum, maximum, average GUI refresh rate).
