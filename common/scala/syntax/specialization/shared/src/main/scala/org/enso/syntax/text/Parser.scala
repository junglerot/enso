/** This is the main Parser class.
  *
  * ==The Macro System==
  *
  * The parser bases on a very sophisticated Macro mechanism, allowing users for
  * unparalleled control and flexibility. The macro systems allows advanced
  * users to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages. In a similar
  * fashion to Lisp, Enso macros can freely transform the syntactic structure of
  * the program. In short, anything that Enso can do to a data structure, Enso
  * macros can do to code. In contrast, in most other languages, the parser's
  * output is purely internal to the language implementation and cannot be
  * manipulated by the programmer.
  *
  * Macro resolution steps:
  *
  * 1. Parser is executed by using the [[Parser#run]] function. It reads source
  * code and outputs a token stream [[AST.Stream]]. The token stream contains a
  * very narrow range of possible elements: [[AST.Blank]], [[AST.Var]],
  * [[AST.Cons]], [[AST.Opr]], [[AST.Number]], [[AST.Text]], and [[AST.Block]],
  * which contains lines of streams of these elements. Every other AST structure
  * is build by the macro system. Please note that the stream in this step is
  * encoded by using [[AST.App]] on subsequent elements.
  *
  * 2. Parser prepares [[Builtin.registry]] containing predefined set of macro
  * [[AST.Macro.Definition]], which define such constructs as comments, parensed
  * expressions, imports, new data definitions, if-then-else mixfix functions,
  * or even foreign languages support. During this step parser will be also
  * asking interpreter to fill the registry with definitions from other modules.
  * Each [[AST.Macro.Definition]] contains macro segment descriptions and a
  * finalizer, a function transforming matched tokens to final AST. Finalizer is
  * used only if all macro segments were matched correctly.
  *
  * 3. The token stream is partitioned according to registered macros segments.
  * Each macro contains multiple segments. A segment contains of an identifier,
  * like "if" or "then" and a macro [[Pattern]]. Patterns are not used in this
  * step. The AST stream is partitioned solely by segment identifiers. Macros
  * can overlap, for example, [[Builtin.registry]] contains both "if-then" and
  * "if-then-else" macro. When it is impossible to decide which macro to choose,
  * like for the input "(if a) b", [[AST.Macro.Ambiguous]] is returned.
  * Otherwise, each macro segment is matched against corresponding [[Pattern]]
  * and [[AST.Macro.Match]] is returned and stored back in the [[AST.Stream]].
  * Please note, that even if pattern matching fails, the [[AST.Macro.Match]]
  * will be the result. It will contain information about failed patterns.
  *
  * 4. The segment [[Pattern]] is similar to regular expression. It contains
  * around 10 building blocks, such as [[Pattern.Nothing]], which does not
  * consume any input, or [[Pattern.Tok]], allowing matching a specific token,
  * like the "if" keyword. The result, [[Pattern.Match]] is stored in
  * [[AST.Macro.Match]]. The [[Pattern.Match.Err]] is used to mark unsuccessful
  * pattern match fragments, while the [[Pattern.Match.Tok]] is used to provide
  * additional help messages to the end-user. Please note that it is impossible
  * for the pattern match mechanism to break even on malformed user
  * [[AST.Macro.Definition]]. Each definition contains a pre-process step inside
  * of [[AST.Macro.Definition]] constructor, which modifies the user provided
  * rules with checks if the pattern succeed and in case the pattern was used
  * between segments, if it consumed all tokens. In case either of validators
  * fail, all tokens are consumed and marked as an invalid match.
  *
  * 5. A very special pattern is the [[Pattern.Build]] construction, which tells
  * the pattern match mechanism that it should build a single [[AST]] expression
  * out of matched tokens. For example, a pattern
  * [[Pattern.Build(Pattern.Cls[AST.Opr])]] will match an operator token and
  * build a side-section AST from it. The [[Pattern.Build]] blocks are resolved
  * during the pattern match step. After this step is finished and
  * [[AST.Macro.Match]] or [[AST.Macro.Ambiguous]] is stored back in the
  * [[AST.Stream]], nothing more happens, parsing is done! It is important to
  * note, that there is a special module parsing macro, which runs
  * [[Pattern.Build]] on every line.
  *
  *
  *
  * ==Pattern Build Mechanism==
  *
  * The resolution of [[Pattern.Build]] is as interesting as the macro system.
  * It contains of the following stages:
  *
  * 1. First, the [[AST.Stream]] is partitioned byt the [[Distance]] processor
  * according to the spacing information. All non-spaced tokens are grouped
  * together and processed first. After their processing is done and each group
  * will be transformed to a single [[AST]], it is put back to the original
  * [[AST.Stream]] and the whole stream is processed the same way (described in
  * the following points).
  *
  * 2. Each token of a chosen stream is then processed by the
  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm Shunting-yard
  * algorithm]]. Basically, it re-shuffles the [[AST]] stream to combination of
  * [[AST.App]], [[AST.App.Left]], [[AST.App.Right]], and [[AST.App.Sides]],
  * according to the operator precedence. Please note that the precedence of
  * user defined operators is fixed in Enso and depends on the shape of the
  * operator. For example, all "arrows" like "<-", "<-<", or "<=<", have the
  * same precedence. The associativity is inferred by the operator direction,
  * where both "=" and "," operators are considered right-associative. See
  * [[Operator]] and [[Prec]] for more information.
  *
  *
  *
  * ==Finalizers==
  *
  * A careful reader will notice that there was no description of how finalizers
  * (mentioned in the first section) are used. Finalizers are user-provided AST
  * transformations which are applied to valid AST Macro matches. After
  * finalizer is applied, the spacing information might be lost.
  *
  * ==Space-unaware AST===
  *
  * That's because they are NOT used during parsing. A very important design
  * decision is that Enso AST contains all information allowing for printing the
  * code back from the AST, while keeping all whitespaces as they were before
  * parsing. This is why each space-aware AST, like [[AST.App]] records all
  * positional information. For convenient usage, all space-aware [[AST]]
  * definitions end with "Of", like [[AST.App.PrefixOf]] and have a counterpart
  * without "Of" allowing for pattern matching without thinking about the
  * spacing information. Because macro system is end-user extensible, we cannot
  * assume that the end-user will care about recording valid spacing when
  * transforming [[AST]] to another form. That's why there are also
  * space-unaware [[AST]] structures, which are handy to work with by automated
  * tools like the interpreter, while all the spacing information is stored only
  * in the basic set of tokens and [[AST.Macro]] tokens. Each AST node has a
  * [[AST.map]] function for mapping over sub-nodes, which allows easy building
  * of AST traversals. The [[Parser#resolveMacros]] is such a traversal, which
  * applies [[AST.Macro.Definition.Resolver]] to each [[AST.Macro.Match]] found
  * in the AST, while loosing a lot of positional information.

      |      - Optional struct fields.
      |      - Optional function arguments.
      |   `Option`s are commonly paired with pattern matching to query the presence of
      |   a value and take action, always accounting for the None case.

      |
      |     It is a very common type and is used by such types as `Maybe` or `List`.
