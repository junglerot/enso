 * - The `getter` will run even if the ref is not actively observed by any effects (i.e. it is
 * effectively an **always-active watcher**),
 * - The `ref` will only be updated only when the derived value actually changed (as determined by
 *   the `equalFn` equality test).

 * This is most useful for derived values that are accessed often and recompute frequently, but the
 * actual derived result changes very rarely. When in doubt, use `computed` instead.
