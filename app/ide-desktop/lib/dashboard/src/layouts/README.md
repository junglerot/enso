# Layouts

These are components that are supposed to be used only once. In general, this
means that they are very closely tied to the application itself, and cannot be
generalized.

Note that components that are reusable, but specific to certain parts of the
application, belong in `components/<slice>/`, where `<slice>` is the relevant
part of the application.
