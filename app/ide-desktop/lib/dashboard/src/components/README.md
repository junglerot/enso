# Components

This folder contains reusable styled components.

Components designed to take up the full page are located in `pages/`; components
that are supposed to be used only once are located in `layouts/`.

Generic components usable anywhere belong directly in this folder; components
only relevant to a specific part of the app belong in a subfolder named after
the corresponding section.
