/** @file File containing the {@link App} React component, which is the entrypoint into our React
 * application.
 *
 * # Providers
 *
 * The {@link App} component is responsible for defining the global context used by child
 * components. For example, it defines a {@link toast.Toaster}, which is used to display temporary
 * notifications to the user. These global components are defined at the top of the {@link App} so
 * that they are available to all of the child components.
 *
 * The {@link App} also defines various providers (e.g., {@link authProvider.AuthProvider}).
 * Providers are a React-specific concept that allows components to access global state without
 * having to pass it down through the component tree. For example, the
 * {@link authProvider.AuthProvider} wraps the entire application, and provides the context
 * necessary for child components to use the {@link authProvider.useAuth} hook. The
 * {@link authProvider.useAuth} hook lets child components access the user's authentication session
 * (i.e., email, username, etc.) and it also provides methods for signing the user in, etc.
 *
 * Providers consist of a provider component that wraps the application, a context object defined
 * by the provider component, and a hook that can be used by child components to access the context.
 * All of the providers are initialized here, at the {@link App} component to ensure that they are
 * available to all of the child components.
 *
 * # Routes and Authentication
 *
 * The {@link AppRouter} component defines the layout of the application, in terms of navigation. It
 * consists of a list of {@link router.Route}s, as well as the HTTP pathnames that the
 * {@link router.Route}s can be accessed by.
 *
 * The {@link router.Route}s are grouped by authorization level. Some routes are
 * accessed by unauthenticated (i.e., not signed in) users. Some routes are accessed by partially
 * authenticated users (c.f. {@link authProvider.PartialUserSession}). That is, users who have
 * signed up but who have not completed email verification or set a username. The remaining
 * {@link router.Route}s require fully authenticated users (c.f.
 * {@link authProvider.FullUserSession}). */
