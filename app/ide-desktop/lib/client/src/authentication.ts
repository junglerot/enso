/** @file Definition of the Electron-specific parts of the authentication flows of the IDE.
 *
 * # Overview of Authentication/Authorization
 *
 * Actions like creating projects, opening projects, uploading files to the cloud, etc. require the
 * user to be authenticated and authorized. Authenticated means that the user has an account that
 * the application recognizes, and that the user has provided their credentials to prove that they
 * are who they say they are. Authorized means that the user has the necessary permissions to
 * perform the action.
 *
 * Authentication and authorization are provided by the user logging in with their credentials,
 * which we exchange for a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT is sent with every HTTP request to the
 * backend.
 *
 * The authentication module of the dashboard and IDE handles these flows:
 * - registering a new user account,
 * - signing in to an existing user account (in exchange for an access token),
 * - signing out of the user account,
 * - setting the user's username (i.e., display name used in place of their email address),
 * - changing/resetting the user's password,
 * - etc.
 *
 * # Electron Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
 *
 * If the user is signing in through a federated identity provider (e.g., Google or GitHub), the
 * authentication flows need be able to to:
 * - redirect the user from the IDE to external sources (e.g., system web browser), and
 * - redirect the user from external sources to the IDE (e.g., system web browser, email client).
 *
 * The main Electron process can launch the system web browser. The dashboard and IDE are sandboxed,
 * so they can not launch the system web browser. By registering Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
 * listeners in the Electron app, we can bridge this gap, and allow the dashboad + IDE to emit
 * events that signal to the main Electron process to open URLs in the system web browser.
 *
 * ## Redirect To System Web Browser
 *
 * The user must use the system browser to complete sensitive flows such as signup and signin. These
 * flows should not be done in the app as the user cannot be expected to trust the app with their
 * credentials.
 *
 * To redirect the user from the IDE to an external source:
 * 1. Call the {@link initIpc} function to register a listener for
 * {@link ipc.Channel.openUrlInSystemBrowser} IPC events.
 * 2. Emit an {@link ipc.Channel.openUrlInSystemBrowser} event. The listener registered in the
 * {@link initIpc} function will use the {@link opener} library to open the event's {@link URL}
 * argument in the system web browser, in a cross-platform way.
 *
 * ## Redirect To IDE
 *
 * The user must be redirected back to the IDE from the system web browser after completing a
 * sensitive flow such as signup or signin. The user may also be redirected to the IDE from an
 * external source such as an email client after verifying their email address.
 *
 * To handle these redirects, we use deep links. Deep links are URLs that are used to redirect the
 * user to a specific page in the application. To handle deep links, we use a custom URL protocol
 * scheme.
 *
 * To prepare the application to handle deep links:
 * - Register a custom URL protocol scheme with the OS (c.f., `electron-builder-config.ts`).
 * - Define a listener for Electron {@link OPEN_URL_EVENT}s (c.f., {@link initOpenUrlListener}).
 * - Define a listener for {@link ipc.Channel.openDeepLink} events (c.f., `preload.ts`).
 *
 * Then when the user clicks on a deep link from an external source to the IDE:
 * - The OS redirects the user to the application.
 * - The application emits an Electron {@link OPEN_URL_EVENT}.
 * - The {@link OPEN_URL_EVENT} listener checks if the {@link URL} is a deep link.
 * - If the {@link URL} is a deep link, the {@link OPEN_URL_EVENT} listener prevents Electron from
 * handling the event.
 * - The {@link OPEN_URL_EVENT} listener then emits an {@link ipc.Channel.openDeepLink} event.
 * - The {@link ipc.Channel.openDeepLink} listener registered by the dashboard receives the event.
 * Then it parses the {@link URL} from the event's {@link URL} argument. Then it uses the
 * {@link URL} to redirect the user to the dashboard, to the page specified in the {@link URL}'s
 * `pathname`. */
