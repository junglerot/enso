Placeholder to trick `electron-builder` into thinking that its dependencies are
installed.

`electron-builder` checks for presence of `node_modules` directory. If it is not
present, it will install dependencies with `--production` flag (erasing all 
dev-only dependencies). This does not work sensibly with NPM workspaces. We have
our `node_modules` in the root directory, not here.

Without this workaround, `electron-builder` will end up erasing its own
dependencies and failing because of that.
