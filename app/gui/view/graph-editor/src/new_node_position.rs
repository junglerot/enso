/// === New Node Positioning ===
/// ============================

/// Return a position for a newly created node. The position is calculated by establishing a
/// reference position and then aligning it to existing nodes.
///
/// The reference position is chosen from among:
///  - the position of a source node of the dropped edge (if available),
///  - the bottom-most selected node (if available),
///  - the mouse position,
///  - the screen center.
/// The position is then aligned to either:
///  - the source node of the dropped edge (if available),
///  - the selected nodes (if available),
///  - the node closest to the reference position (if available),
///  - not aligned.
/// The choice among the options described above is governed by the `way`.
///
/// The Magnet Alignment algorithm is used to calculate the final position in the following cases:
///  - When creating node with (+) button without nodes selected.
///  - When creating node at mouse cursor, but not under the source node.
///  - When the node is pushed left due to lack of space - only horizontally.
///
/// To learn more about the align algorithm, see the docs of [`aligned_if_close_to_node`].
