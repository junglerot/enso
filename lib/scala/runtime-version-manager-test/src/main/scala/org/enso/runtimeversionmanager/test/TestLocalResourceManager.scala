    * of a single process.

    * The resource locks are not visible by other processes, so this manager is
    * not useful for synchronizing multiple processes. It can be used to test
    * concurrency implementation using threads within the same JVM, in contrary
    * to the default [[FileLockManager]] which can be only used for
    * inter-process synchronization.
    *
    * The [[ResourceManager]] created using that method uses an independent lock
    * manager that is not shared with other resource managers. It is meant to be
    * used for non-concurrent tests. In concurrent tests, each used
    * [[ResourceManager]] should share their [[TestLocalLockManager]] so that
    * all the threads see each other's locks.
