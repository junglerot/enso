/** This is the Enso language parser.
  *
  * It is a wrapper of parser written in Rust that uses JNI to efficiently
  * construct scala AST directly without any serialization overhead.
  *
  * The methods are loaded from a native shared library `parser` that is located
  * in a directory specified by `-Djava.library.path` and has one of the extensions
  * `.dll`, `.so` or `dylib` depending on the platform (windows, linux or mac).
  *
  * The shared library itself is generated into `target/rust/debug` by executing
  * `cargo build -p parser`. Each method marked by `@native` must have a
  * corresponding counterpart in rust, otherwise the loading of the shared library
  * is going to fail at runtime with `UnsatisfiedLinkingError`.
