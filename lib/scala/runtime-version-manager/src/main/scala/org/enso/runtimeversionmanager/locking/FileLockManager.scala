/** [[LockManager]] using file-based locks.
  *
  * This is the [[LockManager]] that should be used in production as it is able
  * to synchronize locks between different processes.
  *
  * Under the hood, it uses the [[FileLock]] mechanism. This mechanism specifies
  * that on some platforms shared locks may not be supported and all shared
  * locks are treated as exclusive locks there. That would be harmful to the
  * user experience by allowing only a single Enso process to be running at the
  * same time as we use shared locks extensively. However, all the platforms we
  * currently support (Linux, macOS, Windows), do support shared locks, so this
  * should not be an issue for us. However, if a shared lock request returns an
  * exclusive lock, a warning is issued, just in case.
