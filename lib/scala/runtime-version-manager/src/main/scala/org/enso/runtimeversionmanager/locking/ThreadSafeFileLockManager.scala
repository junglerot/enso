/** A class that allows to manage locks which synchronize access both between
  * different processes and multiple threads of the current process.
  *
  * It does not have as strong fairness guarantees as [[FileLockManager]], for
  * example, when other processes are holding a shared lock on a resource and
  * the current process tries to acquire an exclusive lock, other threads of the
  * current process will not be able to acquire even shared locks until this
  * other threads acquires and then releases its writer lock (they will wait for
  * it).
  *
  * This weak-fairness issue should not be problematic as it only happens when
  * the same process tries to acquire an exclusive and shared lock for the same
  * resource. This can happen in two kinds of situations:
  * - a short update (updating the config)
  * - a long running operation (install/uninstall a component).
  * In the first case, both reads and writes are short, so scheduling them is
  * not an issue because the wait time will be marginal anyway. In the second
  * case, opening a project while another thread is trying to uninstall the
  * engine (and actively waiting for other processes), will wait until that
  * completes and fail or try to install it again. But that is only the case if
  * a single process both requests the uninstall of an engine and opening a
  * project with the same engine, which from the user's perspective is extremely
  * unlikely (why uninstall an engine and at the same time try to open a project
  * using it).
  *
  * Functions that acquire locks in this class may throw (for example if the
  * underlying file lock fails with an IOException), but if a non-fatal
  * exception is thrown, the function is guaranteed to not have acquired a lock.
  *
  * @param locksRoot the directory in which lockfiles should be kept

  /** A thread-safe wrapper for a file lock - ensures that the process holds at
    * most one file lock for the file, but it can be shared by multiple threads
    * which are properly synchronized.
    *
    * The structure maintains the following invariants (they should always be
    * valid before entering and after exiting the monitor):
    * - either writers or readers can be nonzero, but never both at the same
    *   time
    * - there can be at most 1 writer
    * - the fileLock is Some iff writers + readers > 0
    * - busy == true indicates that one of the threads is waiting to acquire the
    *   proper file lock - no other operations should be taken during that time:
    *   they should either wait or fail immediately, depending on the operation
    *   type
    * - any `try*` operations should fail if busy is set to true
    * - busy == true implies readers + writers == 0
    *   - because the writer lock is only tried to be acquired if
    *     readers + writers == 0
    *   - and the reader filelock is only tried to be acquired if readers == 0
    *    (and writers == 0), as if readers > 0, the filelock is already held
    *   - conversely, readers + writers > 0 implies busy == false
    *
    * The purpose of the busy bit is to avoid long blocking the monitor while
    * waiting to acquire the actual file lock, to guarantee [[tryAcquireLock]]
    * returning without blocking.
    *
    * The busy bit is guaranteed to be reset eventually (it will either reset
    * once the acquireLock operation completes or when it fails and throws an
    * exception).
    *
    * If a release operation fails, we cannot guarantee anything about the
    * status of the resource, so any pending and future operations fail with an
    * exception immediately. If failed == true, the invariants may no longer
    * hold - every operation (besides release) should run `checkFailed` first.
