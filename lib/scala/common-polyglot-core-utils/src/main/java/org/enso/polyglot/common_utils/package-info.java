/**
 * This package contains common utilities which can be used both by the engine runtime and the
 * libraries.
 *
 * <p>This allows us to avoid duplicating code between the runtime and library projects for
 * operations that need to be accessible on both sides.
 *
 * <p>The utilities that belong here are mostly operations that are builtins of the Enso language
 * but also need to be used from our Java libraries where the cost of calling back to Enso methods
 * is relatively high, so accessing the Java implementations directly is desirable. The primary
 * example of that is the algorithm for computing the length of a string by counting the grapheme
 * clusters.
 *
 * <p>Due to classpath separation, the class files of this package will be duplicated with one copy
 * embedded in the engine and another attached as `common-polyglot-core-utils.jar` placed in the
 * `polyglot` directory of the Standard.Base library. But it allows us to avoid duplicating the
 * code, so we can have a single source of truth for each implementation.
 *
 * <p>Due to the copying, the project should not be expanded too much, but all utilities which would
 * end up being duplicated are best moved here.
