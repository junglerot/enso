//! Defines an animation driver for value with soft bounds.
//!
//! This animation is used to animate values with soft bounds. Depending on the input method, the
//! target value might be allowed to exceed the bounds, but after very short time it will smoothly
//! return into the bounds. This is useful for animating scrollbars, where scrolling past the end of
//! the content should be possible for a short time, but the scrollbar should quickly return to the
//! bounds. The sensitivity for setting the value past the bounds is reduced and value is limited to
//! prevent the overshoot from being too large or too jumpy.

// === OvershootAnimation ===
// ==========================

/// An [`Animation`] wrapper that allows the value to be smoothly manipulated within set bounds,
/// overshoot set bounds and bounce back. This is accomplished by modulating and limiting the target
/// value passed to the internal Animation once its out of bounds.
///
/// ## Input controls
/// - The bounds are set using `set_min_bound` and `set_max_bound` endpoints. Set bounds will be
///   applied next time a target value change is attempted.
/// - The target value can be manipulated by relative change using `*_change_by` endpoints or set to
///   absolute value using `*_change_to` endpoints. Using `soft_*` endpoints will limit the target
///   value smoothly over time, while using `hard_*` endpoints will immediately apply the bounds to
///   the target value, not allowing any overshoot.
/// - The maximum allowed out-of-bounds amplitude can be set with `set_overshoot_limit` endpoint.
/// - When an event is emitted to the `skip` endpoint, the animated value will immediately be set
///   the current target value, within the set bounds. Any overshoot is removed.
/// - The delay between when the target value is set and when the bounce back animation starts is
///   controlled with `set_bounce_delay` endpoint.
///
/// ## Overshoot behavior
/// When the target value is set out of bounds using `*_soft` endpoint, the out-of-bounds portion of
/// the value is modulated with `OUT_OF_BOUNDS_SENSITIVITY` constant factor, and potentially limited
/// by value set through `set_overshoot_limit` endpoint. Many target value changes can be applied in
/// quick succession. After a `set_bounce_delay` amount of time passes since last target change, the
/// bounce-back animation is applied by snapping the target value to the closest bound.
