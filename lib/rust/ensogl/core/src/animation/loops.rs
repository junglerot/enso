/// performance-related issues.
///
///
/// # Events scheduling in Chrome
/// The following graph shows an example order of tasks per frame with the assumptions that all the
/// frame tasks can be executed within that frame and the application runs with native FPS.
///
/// ```text
///             ║    Frame 1     ║    Frame 2     ║    Frame 3     ║ ...
/// Idle time   ║█            ███║██         █████║████           █║ ...
/// Other tasks ║ █          █   ║  █       █     ║    █        █  ║ ...
/// I/O Events  ║  ██   █████    ║      ████      ║     █   ████   ║ ...
/// RAF         ║    ███         ║   ███          ║      ███       ║ ...
/// GPU         ║      ████      ║     ███        ║        ██████  ║ ...
/// ```
///
/// A few things should be noted here:
///
/// - **Frame start idle time.** At the beginning of almost every frame, there will be an idle time
///   of up to a few milliseconds (we've observed idle times between 0 ms and 4 ms). This time is
///   likely caused by frames being synchronized with the screen refresh rate, while the tasks are
///   performed by the Chrome task scheduler, which is not fired at the synchronization points. To
///   learn more, see [this link](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=607650). It
///   is not clear whether Chrome considers this a bug or if they will ever fix it.
///
/// - **Other tasks.** These are Chrome-internal tasks. For example, before every animation frame,
///   Chrome performs some preparation work, which in most cases is very short (we've observed times
///   between 20 μs and 40 μs). At the end of the frame, Chrome performs pre-paint, layout,
///   layerize, and commit jobs, which, in the case of EnsoGL applications (when no HTML elements
///   are on the stage), are also short, ranging between 0.1 ms and 0.5 ms.
///
/// - **I/O Events.** Events such as mouse down/up/move can be scheduled before or after the RAF
///   callback. Some of these events might originate in the previous frame, and their handling might
///   be scheduled for the next frame by Chrome.
///
/// - **RAF.** The RAF (Request Animation Frame) callback triggers WebGL per-frame functions, such
///   as animations, Display Object layout recomputation, WebGL buffer updates, and invoking WebGL
///   draw calls.
///
/// - **GPU.** The GPU-related work starts at the end of the RAF callback, as soon as the first
///   WebGL calls are issued. It is performed in parallel with the rest of the RAF callback, I/O
///   events, and other tasks performed by Chrome.
///
/// In case the total time of all the per-frame tasks is longer than the frame duration with the
/// native refresh rate, some frames might be skipped, and a very interesting time report behavior
/// can be observed. Let's consider the following events graph:
///
/// ```text
///             ║ Real frame 1 work  ┆          Real frame 2 work         ┆            ...
///             ║    Frame 1     ║   ┆Frame 2     ║ Frame 3 (skip) ║    Frame 4     ║  ...
/// Idle time   ║███             ║   ┆            ║                ║      ┆         ║  ...
/// Other tasks ║   █            ║  █┆            ║                ║     █┆         ║  ...
/// RAF         ║    ██████████  ║   ┆  ██████████████████████████████    ┆ ██████████ ...
/// I/O Events  ║              █████ ┆██          ║                ║  ██  ┆█        ║  ...
/// GPU         ║              ███   ┆            ║                ║     █┆         ║  ...
/// ```
///
/// A few things should be noted here:
///
/// - **Frame start idle time.** As previously mentioned, we can observe an idle time at the
///   beginning of the first frame. The Chrome task scheduler rendered the previous frame in time,
///   so there was no pressure to start the next tasks immediately. However, there is no idle time
///   present in the next frames as their computations took longer than the native frame duration.
///
/// - **Frame times.** Even if the real computation time can exceed the time of a few frames issued
///   with the native refresh rate, the frames are always scheduled with the native refresh rate
///   time. Thus, some of these frames might be skipped, like frame 3 in the example above.
///
/// - **RAF start time.** When the RAF callback is called, it is provided with the frame start time.
///   However, this time might be smaller than the time reported by performance.now(). For example,
///   in the graph above, the third call to the RAF callback will report the beginning time of frame
///   4, even though it was performed in the middle of frame 4. If we measured the time at the end
///   of the second RAF callback with performance.now(), this time would be bigger than the time
///   reported by the third RAF callback.
///
///
/// # It is impossible to measure correct CPU-time from within JavaScript.
/// In Chrome, it is possible to get precise results of the GPU time (see
/// [ExtDisjointTimerQueryWebgl2]). However, even if we measure the time of all I/O events and the
/// time of the RAF callback, we cannot measure the time of the other tasks performed by Chrome
/// because we cannot register an event at the end of the per-frame job. Thus, when measuring
/// performance within the application, the only reliable way is to base it on the time reported by
/// the RAF callback and the GPU time measurements.
