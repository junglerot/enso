/// The width and height of all icons.

/// This constant exists for development purposes only, and is published for debug scene.
/// Due to a rendering error, shapes appear too big when the camera is zoomed in very closely.
/// (Documented here: https://github.com/enso-org/ide/issues/1698)
/// In the user interface, this is not a big problem, since icon are usually shown at lower zoom
/// levels. But it is a problem during development of icon when it becomes necessary to inspect
/// them closely. In those situations, one can apply `.shrink(0.35)` to shapes to compensate for the
/// bug and make them appear at the correct size while the camera is zoomed in. But that work-around
/// will make them appear too thin on the default zoom level.
///
/// To make it easy to turn this shrinking on and off before and after working on icon, we define
/// the constant `SHRINK_AMOUNT` and apply `.shrink(SHRINK_AMOUNT.px())` to all icon. In every
/// commit, `SHRINK_AMOUNT` should be set to 0.0 to make icon look best in the user interface. But
/// during work on the icon, it can temporarily be set to 0.35.
