//! UI components that allows picking a number or range through mouse interaction. We have a number
//! picker that allows to pick a number in a range and a range picker that allows to pick a range.
//!
//! Both share the same model (i.e., arrangement of shapes), but they have different logic about
//! using the features of the shapes making up the model and handling interactions. The base model
//! is implemented in `model.rs` and the logic for the number and range picker are placed in
//! `number.rs` and `range.rs` respectively. The rest of the sub-modules contain utilities.
//!
//! The only things exposed form this module are the `NumberPicker`, `NumberRangePicker`, their
//! FRPs and the `Bounds` struct.
