// =======================

// =======================

/// Periodic timer with additional initial delay.
///
/// The timer will generate `on_trigger` events over time, as long as it is active.
///
/// The timer is activated when `restart` receives an event with [`DelayedIntervalConfig`] structure
/// containing `delay_ms` and `interval_ms` values. Every activation begins a sequence of actions:
///     - If the timer was already active, it is stopped and started again.
///     - First `on_trigger` event will be emitted after specified `delay_ms` time.
///     - Subsequent `on_trigger` events will be emitted every `interval_ms` time.
/// Once `stop` receives an event, no more `on_trigger` events will be emitted until the timer
/// is activated again.
///
/// in `restart`:     -5,2--------------3,1-----4,3-----------------
/// in `stop`:        -------------x-----------------------x---x----
/// out `on_trigger`: ------x-x-x-x--------xxxxx----x--x--x---------
///
/// The timer is based on `setTimeout` and `setInterval` browser APIs. That means there is no
/// guarantee about when exactly the events will be emitted. In practice, the initial delay might be
/// slightly longer and there might be some jitter in periodic triggers. This effect will be more
/// pronounced when the browser event loop is very busy.
