# Enso Documentation
This folder contains the documentation for the implementation of the Enso
programming language. The documentation is generally broken up into three
categories: design, specification, and implementation.

- **Design:** Documents in this category deal with the reasoning behind the 
  language specification.
- **Specification:** The language specification.
- **Implementation:** Details of how the specification is _implemented_ in the
  compiler and the runtime.

It is broken up into categories as follows:

- **[Language Server](language-server/):** Documentation pertaining to the Enso
  language server.
- **[Runtime](runtime/):** Documentation pertaining to the Enso runtime.
- **[Semantics](semantics/):** Documentation pertaining to the Enso language
  semantics, insofar as it is seperable from the other categories.
- **[Style Guides](style-guides/):** Style guides for the various languages with
  which we work.
- **[Syntax](syntax/):** Documentation pertaining to the syntax of Enso.
- **[Types](types/):** Documentation pertaining to Enso's type system.
- **[Enso Philosophy](enso-philosophy.md):** Information on the design
  philosophy that underlies the development of Enso.
