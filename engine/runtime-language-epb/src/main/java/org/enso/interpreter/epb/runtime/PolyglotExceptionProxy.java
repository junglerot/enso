/**
 * A wrapper for exceptions that cross the polyglot boundary.
 *
 * <p>It is responsible for proxying messages across the polyglot boundary specifically for the case
 * of exceptions. Without this, exceptions (as non-linear control flow) would bubble up into Enso
 * without their context. This would allow them to be caught, but Enso would have no means of
 * executing code on the guest-language exception. Instead, we wrap the exception into this proxy,
 * which holds onto the foreign exception, as well as the two contexts necessary for mediating calls
 * between Enso and the foreign language.
 *
 * <p>This is _separate_ to the {@link PolyglotProxy} as we did not want to make that proxy into an
 * {@link AbstractTruffleException}. This means that we have more control over when foreign objects
 * are represented as exceptions.
