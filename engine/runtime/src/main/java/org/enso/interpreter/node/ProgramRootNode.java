  /* Note [Static Passes]
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * Almost all of the static analysis functionality required by the interpreter requires access to
   * the interpreter to execute small amounts of code. This is for purposes such as:
   * - Type-level computation and evaluation during typechecking.
   * - Compile-Time Function Evaluation (CTFE) for optimisation.
   * - Various other re-write mechanisms that involve code execution.
   *
   * The contract expected from a Truffle Language states that there is to be no access to the
   * interpreter context during parsing, which is the most natural time to perform these
   * transformation passes. As a result, we have to perform them inside the interpreter once parsing
   * is completed.
   *
   * To that end, we have a special kind of root node. It is constructed with the input AST only,
   * and when executed acts as follows:
   * 1. It takes the input source and executes a sequence of analyses and transformations such that
   *    the end result is a `Node`-based AST representing the program.
   * 2. It rewrites itself to contain the program, and then executes that program.
   *
   * Note [Static Passes (Lack of Profiling)]
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * While it is, in general, good practice to profile branches that don't depend on compilation
   * final values in a truffle interpreter, this `if` is only ever executed once. This means that
   * there is no need to profile it as the knowledge can't be used by the partial evaluator in any
   * case.

   *
   * To do this, we set a variable internally, that is then passed to the program just before it is
