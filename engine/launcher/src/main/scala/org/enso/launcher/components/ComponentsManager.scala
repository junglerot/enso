/* Note [Components Manager Concurrency Model]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The [[ComponentsManager]] itself is not synchronized as it should be used in
 * the launcher from a single thread. However, multiple launcher instances may
 * run at the same time and their operations have to be synchronized to some
 * extent, especially to avoid two processes modifying the same engine version.
 *
 * The concurrency is managed as follows:
 *
 * 1. `withEngine` and `withEngineAndRuntime` acquire shared locks for the
 *    engine (and in the second case also for the runtime) and can be used to
 *    safely run a process using the engine ensuring that the engine will not be
 *    uninstalled while that process is running. As the locks are shared,
 *    multiple processes can use the same engine or runtime for running. These
 *    functions may install the missing engine or runtime as described below.
 *    The installation acquires an exclusive lock for the component, but to
 *    avoid keeping that lock when launching a possibly long-running process, it
 *    is released and a shared lock is re-acquired, so that other processes can
 *    start using the newly installed engine in parallel. As the underlying
 *    mechanism does not support lock downgrade, the lock is released for a very
 *    short time. Theoretically, it is possible for an uninstall command to
 *    start in this short time-window and remove the just-installed component.
 *    To avoid errors, after re-acquiring the shared lock, the engine and
 *    runtime components are re-checked to ensure that they have not been
 *    uninstalled in the meantime. In the unlikely case that one of them was
 *    removed, an error is reported and execution is terminated.
 * 2. `uninstallEngine` acquires an exclusive lock on the affected engine (so no
 *    other process can be using it) and removes it. Additionally it runs a
 *    runtime cleanup, removing any runtimes that are not used anymore. For that
 *    cleanup to be safe, add-remove-components lock is acquired which
 *    guarantees that no other installations are run in parallel.
 * 2. `findOrInstallEngine` and `findOrInstallRuntime` do not normally use
 *    locking, so their result is immediately invalidated - if the caller wants
 *    to have any guarantees they have to acquire a lock *after* getting the
 *    result and re-check its validity, as described in (1). In case the
 *    requested component is missing, an exclusive lock for it is acquired along
 *    with a shared lock for add-remove-components for the time of the
 *    installation, but all locks are released before returning from this
 *    function.
 * 3. `installRuntime` does not acquire any locks, it relies on its caller to
 *    acquire an exclusive lock for add-remove-components and the affected
 *    runtime.
 * 4. `installEngine` relies on the caller to acquire an exclusive lock for
 *    add-remove-components and the affected engine, but it may itself acquire a
 *    a shared or exclusive lock for the runtime (the exclusive lock is acquired
 *    if the runtime is missing and has to be installed).
 * 5. Other functions do not acquire or require any locks. Their results are
 *    immediately invalidated, so they should only be used for non-safety
 *    critical operations, like listing available engines.
 *
 * To summarize, components management (install and uninstall) is synchronized
 * for safety. Other operations are mostly unsynchronized. If a guarantee is
 * expected that the engine (and possibly its runtime) are not modified when
 * running a command, `withEngine` or `withEngineAndRuntime` should be used.
