/* Note [Windows Path]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * On Windows, the environment variables are usually treated as case-insensitive
 * but not all the time. When launching a process with an added environment
 * variable called `PATH`, that process actually has two variables in its
 * environment - the original `Path` and the overriden `PATH`. This can be seen
 * when querying `System.getenv()` - the returned map contains both `Path` and
 * `PATH` with their respective values. However, `System.getenv("PATH")` uses
 * some platform specific logic, and even if both variables are present in the
 * environment, it actually returns the value corresponding to `Path`. This is
 * likely the expected behaviour on Windows. So to successfully override the
 * system path on Windows, we need to override `Path`, not `PATH` like on
 * Unix-based systems.
