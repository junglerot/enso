## Types representing the ordering of values.

   These are intended to be returned from the `compare_to` function, that has a
   type as follows for a type `A`: `A.compare_to : A -> Ordering`.

   The result should be returned in terms of how `this` orders in comparison to
   `that`. So, if `this` is greater than `that`, you should return `Greater.`
type Ordering
    ## An ordering where a compared value is less than another.
    type Less
    ## An ordering where a compared value is equal to another.
    type Equal
    ## An ordering where a compared value is greater than another.
    type Greater

## A descriptor for a sort ordering.
type Sort_Order
    ## Elements should be sorted in ascending order.
    type Ascending
    ## Elements should be sorted in descending order.
    type Descending
