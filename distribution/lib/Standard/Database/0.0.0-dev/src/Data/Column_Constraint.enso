from Standard.Base import all

## ADVANCED
   Specifies additional properties for a column created using
   `Connection.create_table`.

   The support for the constraints may vary between databases.
type Column_Constraint
    ## ADVANCED
       Specifies a default value for the column.

       Argument:
       - `sql_expression`: The SQL expression to use as the default value. Note that this is a raw SQL expression, so if you want to set a default to a string, you must include the quotes. The quoting style may depend on the database. Never pass unsanitized data to this parameter.

       ! SQL Injection

         Since `sql_expression` is a raw SQL expression, note that malicious
         data can cause execution of arbitrary SQL queries. Only use this
         parameter with trusted data.
    Default_Expression (sql_expression : Text)

    ## PRIVATE
       DEPRECATED This will be replaced by extending the `Value_Type` with the concept of non-nullable types. TODO in #5872

       Specifies that the column does not accept `NULL` values.
    Not_Null
