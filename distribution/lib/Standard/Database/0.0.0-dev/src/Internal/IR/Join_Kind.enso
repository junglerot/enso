    ## PRIVATE

       Left join.

       The result will contain all rows from the left source. Some of them may
       be duplicated if they have multiple matches on the right. If a row from
       the left source has no match on the right, it will be present exactly
       once in the result and the fields corresponding to the right source will
       be set to NULL.

    ## PRIVATE

       Right join.

       The result will contain all rows from the right source. Some of them may
       be duplicated if they have multiple matches on the left. If a row from
       the right source has no match on the left, it will be present exactly
       once in the result and the fields corresponding to the left source will
       be set to NULL.

    ## PRIVATE

       Cross join.

       The result will contain a cross product of rows from the left source with
       the right source. Its `on` list should be empty, instead `where_filters`
       in the query can be used to filter the results.
