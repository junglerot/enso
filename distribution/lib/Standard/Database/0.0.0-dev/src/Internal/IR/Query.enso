## PRIVATE

   Describes a full SQL query.
type Query

    ## PRIVATE

       A Select SQL query.

       Arguments:
       - expressions: List of pairs specifying the columns to materialize; each
         is a pair whose first element is the name of the materialized column
         and the second element is the expression to compute. If `Nothing` is
         provided, all available columns will be selected.
       - context: The query context, see `Context` for more detail.
    Select (expressions : Nothing | Vector (Pair Text SQL_Expression)) (context : Context)

    ## PRIVATE

       An Insert SQL query that inserts a single row to the table.

       Arguments:
       - table_name: The name of the table to insert to.
       - pairs: A list of pairs consisting of a column name and and expression.
    Insert table_name pairs

    ## PRIVATE

       An SQL query that creates a new table.

       Arguments:
       - table_name: the name of the table.
       - columns: descriptions of table columns. Each column is described by a
         pair of its name and the text representation of its SQL type.
       - primary_key: a vector of names of primary key columns or `Nothing` if
         no primary key should be set. The column names are not checked, it is
         the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the columns in
         `primary_key` actually exist in `columns`, as otherwise the behavior is
         undefined (most likely will result in an `SQL_Error` once executed).
       - temporary: specifies if the table should be marked as temporary.
    Create_Table (table_name:Text) (columns : Vector (Pair Text Text)) (primary_key : Vector Text) (temporary : Boolean)

    ## PRIVATE
       An SQL query that drops a table.
    Drop_Table (table_name:Text)

    ## PRIVATE
       An INSERT INTO ... SELECT query that allows to insert results of a query
       into an existing table.
    Insert_From_Select (table_name:Text) (select:Query)
