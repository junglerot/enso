## PRIVATE

   Used as part of the context, specifies the sources of the query.
type From_Spec
    ## PRIVATE

       A query source that takes data directly from a table in the
       database.

       Arguments:
       - table_name: the full name identifying the table in the database.
       - alias: the name upon which the table can be referred to in other
         parts of the query, this is especially useful for example in
         self-joins, allowing to differentiate between different instances of
         the same table.
    From_Table (table_name : Text) (alias : Text)

    ## PRIVATE

       A query source that holds a raw SQL statement.

       Arguments:
       - raw_sql: the raw SQL code of a query used as a source for this table.
       - alias: the name upon which the table can be referred to in other
         parts of the query, this is especially useful for example in
         self-joins, allowing to differentiate between different instances of
         the same table.
    From_Query (raw_sql : Text) (alias : Text)

    ## PRIVATE

       A query source that performs a join operation on two sources.

       Arguments:
       - kind: the kind of the join.
       - left_spec: the left data source to be joined
       - right_spec: the right data source to be joined
       - on: a list of expressions that will be used as join conditions, these
         are usually be equalities between expressions from the left and right
         sources.
    Join (kind : Join_Kind) (left_spec : From_Spec) (right_spec : From_Spec) (on : Vector SQL_Expression)

    ## PRIVATE

       A query source consisting of a sub-query.

       Arguments:
       - columns: a list of pairs; each first element is the alias for the
         column created in the sub-query and the second element is the
         expression to be computed.
       - context: the context for the sub-query.
       - alias: the name upon which the results of this sub-query can be
         referred to in other parts of the query.
    Sub_Query (columns : Vector (Pair Text SQL_Expression)) (context : Context) (alias : Text)
