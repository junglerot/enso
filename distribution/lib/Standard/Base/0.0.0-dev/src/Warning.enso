## A representation of a dataflow warning attached to a value.
type Warning
    ## PRIVATE

       The constructor to wrap primitive warnings.
    type Warning prim_warning

    ## UNSTABLE

       Returns the warning value â€“ usually its explanation or other contents.
    value : Any
    value = Prim_Warning.get_value this.prim_warning

    ## UNSTABLE
       ADVANCED

       A stack trace for the original warning creation.
    origin : Vector.Vector Stack_Trace_Element
    origin = Prim_Warning.get_origin this.prim_warning

    ## UNSTABLE
       ADVANCED

       A list of locations where the warning was reassigned in the order of
       latest-first.

       Warnings are reassigned whenever they interract with specific language
       elements:
       - When pattern matching, the warnings of the scrutinee will be reassigned
         to the `case` expression result.
       - When calling a method, warnings assigned to `this` will be reassigned to
         the method return value.
       - When calling a polyglot function or method, warnings assigned to any
         arguments will be accumulated in the return value.
       - The standard library methods reassign warnings such that their dataflow
         nature is preserved.
    reassignments : Vector.Vector Stack_Trace_Element
    reassignments =
        Vector.Vector (Prim_Warning.get_reassignments this.prim_warning) . map r->
            loc = case Polyglot.has_source_location r of
                False -> Nothing
                True -> Source_Location (Polyglot.get_source_location r)
            Stack_Trace_Element (Polyglot.get_executable_name r) loc

## UNSTABLE

   Attaches a new warning to the value.
attach : Any -> Any -> Any
attach warning value =
    origin = Runtime.get_stack_trace
    Prim_Warning.attach value warning (origin.drop_start 1)

## UNSTABLE

   Gets all the warnings attached to the given value. Warnings are returned in the
   reverse-chronological order with respect to their attachment time.
get_all : Any -> Vector.Vector Warning
get_all value =
    Vector.Vector (Prim_Warning.get_all value) . map Warning

## UNSTABLE
   ADVANCED

   Sets a new list of warnings for the given value. Any warnings already present
   in `value` will be lost.
set warnings value =
    Prim_Warning.set value (warnings.map .prim_warning).to_array
