type Nothing
    ## The type that has only a singleton value. Nothing in Enso is used as an
       universal value to indicate the lack of presence of a value.

       It is often used alongside a value of type a to provide a Maybe or
       Option abstraction. The type a | Nothing is semantically equivalent to
       Maybe a.
