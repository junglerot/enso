   If a Number is expected, then the program can provide either a Decimal or
   an Integer in its place.

type Number
    ## ALIAS Add, Plus
       Adds two arbitrary numbers.

       Arguments:
       - that: The number to add to this.

       Addition in Enso will undergo automatic conversions such that you need
       not convert between Integer and Decimal manually.

    ## Returns the smaller value of `self` and `that`.

       Arguments:
       - that: The number to compare `self` against.

       ? Math.min or Number.min
         While we provide the min method on `Number`, we find it more intuitive to
         write `Math.min a b` rather than `a.min b`. To that end, we recommend using
         the first style.

       > Example
         Find the minimum of 2 and 5.

             2.min 5

       ? Math.max or Number.max
         While we provide the max method on `Number`, we find it more intuitive to
         write `Math.max a b` rather than `a.max b`. To that end, we recommend using
         the first style.

       > Example
         Find the maximum of 2 and 5.

             2.max 5
    max : Number -> Number
    max self that = if self > that then self else that

    negative_infinity : Decimal
    negative_infinity = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY

    ## A constant holding the floating-point Not-a-Number value.
    nan : Decimal
    nan = Double.NaN

    ## Checks if the given number is the floating-point Not-a-Number value.

       This is needed, because the NaN value will return `False` even when being
       compared with itself, so `x == Number.nan` would not work.
    is_nan : Boolean
    is_nan self = case self of
        _ : Decimal -> Double.isNaN self
        _ -> False

    ## Checks if the given number is infinite.

       The absolute value of a positive number is itself, while the absolute
       value of a negative number is that number multiplied by -1.

       > Example
         Computing the absolute value of -10.63.

            -10.63.abs
    abs : Decimal

    ## ALIAS int

       Truncate a floating-point number to an integer by dropping the fractional
       part. This is equivalent to "round-toward-zero".
    truncate : Integer
    truncate self = self.truncate_builtin

    ## Round to a specified number of decimal places.

       By default, rounding uses "asymmetric round-half-up", also known as
       "round towards positive infinity." If use_bankers=True, then it uses
       "round-half-even", also known as "banker's rounding".

       If `decimal_places` > 0, `round` returns a `Decimal`; otherwise, it
       returns an `Integer`.

       If the argument is `NaN` or `+/-Inf`, an `Arithmetic_Error` error is
       thrown.

       Arguments:
       - decimal_places: The number of decimal places to round to. Can be
         negative, which results in rounding to positive integer powers of 10.
         Must be between -15 and 15 (inclusive).
       - use_bankers: Rounds mid-point to nearest even number.

       ! Error Conditions

         If `decimal_places` is outside the range -15..15 (inclusive), an
         `Illegal_Argument` error is thrown.

       ? Negative decimal place counts
         Rounding to `n` digits can be thought of as "rounding to the nearest
         multiple of 10^(-n)". For negative decimal counts, this results in
         rounding to the nearest positive integer power of 10.

       > Example
         Round to the nearest integer.

            3.3 . round == 3

       > Example
         Round to two decimal places.

            3.1415 . round 2 == 3.14

       > Example
         Round to the nearest hundred.

            1234.0 . round -2 == 1200

       > Example
         Use Banker's Rounding.

    ## Convert this to a decimal.

       This is a no-op on decimals, but is provided for completeness of the Enso
       Number API.

       > Example
         Convert 5.0 to a decimal to get 5.0.

             5.0.to_decimal
    to_decimal : Decimal
    to_decimal self = @Builtin_Method "Decimal.to_decimal"

    ## ALIAS From Text

       Parses a textual representation of a decimal into a decimal number, returning
       a `Number_Parse_Error` if the text does not represent a valid decimal.

       Arguments:
       - text: The text to parse into a decimal.
       - locale: The locale that specifies the format to use when parsing

       > Example
         Parse the text "7.6" into a decimal number.

             Decimal.parse "7.6"
    parse : Text -> Locale | Nothing -> Decimal ! Number_Parse_Error
    parse text locale=Nothing = case locale of
        Nothing -> Panic.catch NumberFormatException (Double.parseDouble text) _->
            Error.throw (Number_Parse_Error.Error text)
        Locale.Value java_locale -> Panic.catch ParseException ((NumberFormat.getInstance java_locale).parse text) _->
            Error.throw (Number_Parse_Error.Error text)

## Integer is the type of integral numbers in Enso. They are of unbounded
   size and can grow as large as necessary.

   ? Representation
     For certain operations (such as bitwise logic), the underlying
     representation of the number matters. Enso Integers are represented as
     signed 2's complement numbers.

   ? Performance
     Integers that fit into 64 bits are represented in memory as 64 bits.
     This means that operations on them achieve excellent performance. Once
     the integer grows beyond being able to fit in 64 bits, performance will
     degrade.
@Builtin_Type

    ## ALIAS Add, Plus
       Adds an integer and an arbitrary number.

       Arguments:
       - that: The number to add to this.

       Addition in Enso will undergo automatic conversions such that you need
       not convert between Integer and Decimal manually.

    ## ALIAS Subtract, Minus

    ## Round to a specified number of decimal places.

       For integers, rounding to 0 or more decimal places simply returns the
       argument. For negative decimal places, see below.

       By default, rounding uses "asymmetric round-half-up", also known as
       "round towards positive infinity." If use_bankers=True, then it uses
       "round-half-even", also known as "banker's rounding".

       Arguments:
       - decimal_places: The number of decimal places to round to. Can be
         negative, which results in rounding to positive integer powers of 10.
         Must be between -15 and 15 (inclusive).
       - use_bankers: Rounds mid-point to nearest even number.

       ! Error Conditions
         Throws `Illegal_Argument` if the number is 15 or more decimal places.
         Above 14 digits, it is possible that the underlying long, converted to
         double in the rounding process, would lose precision in the least
         significant bits.
         (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format.)

         If `decimal_places` is outside the range -15..15 (inclusive), an
         `Illegal_Argument` error is thrown.

       ? Negative decimal place counts
         Rounding to `n` digits can be thought of as "rounding to the nearest
         multiple of 10^(-n)". For negative decimal counts, this results in
         rounding to the nearest positive integer power of 10.

       > Example
         Round an integer (returns the value unchanged).

            3 . round == 3

       > Example

            2511 . round -3 == 3000

       > Example
