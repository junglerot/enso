## Creates a new vector of the given length, initializing elements using
   the provided constructor function.

   Arguments:
   - length: The length of the vector (>= 0).
   - constructor: A function taking the index in the vector and returning an
     item for that index in the vector.

   A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements in linear memory. It
   is the recommended data structure for most applications.

   > Example
     Create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 50.
         Vector.new 50 (ix -> ix + 1)

   > Example
     Create a copy of the given vector (`my_vec`).

         Vector.new my_vec.length (ix -> my_vec.at ix)
new : Number -> (Number -> Any) -> Vector Any
new length constructor =
    arr = Array.new length
    0.up_to length . each ix-> arr.set_at ix (constructor ix)
    Vector arr

## Creates a new vector of the given length, filling the elements with
   the provided constant.

   Arguments:
   - length: The length of the vector (>= 0).
   - constructor: A value fo be placed into each element of the vector.

   A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements in linear memory. It
   is the recommended data structure for most applications.

   > Example
     Create a vector containing 50 elements, each being the number `42`.

         Vector.fill length=50 item=42
fill : Number -> Any -> Vector Any
fill length ~item =
    arr = Array.new length
    0.up_to length . each ix-> arr.set_at ix item
    Vector arr

## Creates a new vector builder instance.

   A vector builder is a mutable data structure, that allows for gathering
   a number of elements and then converting them into a vector. This is
   particularly useful when the number of elements is not known upfront.

   A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements in linear memory. It
   is the recommended data structure for most applications.

   > Example
     Construct a vector using a builder that contains the items 1 to 10.

         example_new_builder =
              builder = Vector.new_builder
              do_build start stop =
                  builder.append start
                  if start >= stop then Nothing else
                      @Tail_Call do_build start+1 stop
              do_build 1 10
              builder.to_vector
new_builder : Builder
new_builder = Builder.new

## ADVANCED

   Converts a polyglot value representing an array into a vector.

   Arguments:
   - arr: The polyglot array value to wrap into a vector.

   This is useful when wrapping polyglot APIs for further use in Enso.

   A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements in linear memory. It
   is the recommended data structure for most applications.

   ! Value Copying
     As Enso vectors implement immutable semantics, this constructor function
     makes a copy of each value in the argument array.

     If this didn't happen then it would be possible for the underlying array to
     be mutated under the hood, and sneak mutability into our immutable data.

from_array arr = here.new (Polyglot.get_array_size arr) (arr.at _)

       The basic, immutable, vector type.

       Arguments:
       - to_array: The underlying array.

       A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements, in linear memory.
       It is the recommended data structure for most applications.

       > Example
         A vector containing the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`, in this order is:
             [1, 2, 3]

       > Example
         A vector containing 50 elements, each being the number `42`, can be
         created by:
             Vector.fill length=50 item=42
    type Vector to_array

    ## Returns the number of elements stored in this vector.

       > Example
         Checking the length of a vector.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].length
    length : Number
    length = Polyglot.get_array_size this.to_array

    ## Gets an element from the vector at a specified index (0-based).

       Arguments:
       - index: The location in the vector to get the element from. The index is
         also allowed be negative, then the elements are indexed from the back
         of the vector, i.e. -1 will correspond to the last element.

       > Example
         Get the second element of a vector.

             [1, 2, 3].at 1 == 2

       > Example
         Get the last element of a vector.

             [1, 2, 3].at -1 == 3
    at : Integer -> Any ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
    at index =
        actual_index = if index < 0 then this.length + index else index
        ## TODO [RW] Ideally we do not want an additional check here, but we
           should catch a Invalid_Array_Index_Error panic. However, such a catch
           should still properly forward any other panics or dataflow errors
           which is not fully possible until the approach to handling Panics is
           improved, as described in the following Pivotal ticket:
           https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2539304/stories/181029230
        if actual_index>=0 && actual_index<this.length then this.unsafe_at actual_index else

       An unsafe variant of the `at` operation. It only allows non-negative
       indices and will panic with a raw Java exception on out-of-bounds access.
       Thus it should only be used when the access is guaranteed to be within
       bounds or with additional error handling.

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].slice 2 5 == [3, 4, 5]
    take : Integer -> Integer -> Vector Any
    take start end =
        slice_start = Math.max 0 start
        slice_end = Math.min this.length end

            if (slice_start == 0) && (slice_end == this.length) then this else
                len = slice_end - slice_start
                arr = Array.new len
                Array.copy this.to_array slice_start arr 0 len
                Vector arr

    ## Creates a new vector with the first `count` elements in `this` removed.

       Arguments:
       - count: The number of elements to drop from the start of `this`.

       > Example
         Remove the first element from the start of the vector.

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].drop_start 1

       - count: The number of elements to drop from the end of `this`.

       > Example
         Remove the last two elements from the end of the vector.

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].drop_end 2
    drop_end : Integer -> Vector Any
    drop_end count = this.take 0 (this.length - count)

    ## Creates a new vector, consisting of the first `count` elements on the
       left of `this`.

       Arguments:
       - count: The number of elements to take from the start of `this`.

       > Example
         Create a new vector from the first two elements of the vector.

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].take_start 2
    take_start : Integer -> Vector Any
    take_start count = this.take 0 count

    ## Creates a new vector, consisting of the last `count` elements on the
       right of `this`.

       Arguments:
       - count: The number of elements to take from the end of `this`.

       > Example
         Create a new vector from the last two elements of the vector.

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].take_end 3
    take_end : Integer -> Vector Any
    take_end count = this.take (this.length - count) this.length

    ## Performs a pair-wise operation passed in `function` on consecutive
       elements of `this` and `that`.

       Arguments:
       - that: The vector to zip with `this`.
       - function: The function used to combine pairwise elements of `this` and
         `that`.

       The result of this function is a vector of length being the shorter of
       `this` and `that`, containing results of calling `function`.

       > Example
         Calculate the pairwise sum of two vectors.

             [1, 2, 3].zip [4, 5, 6] (+)

       > Example
         When the `function` is not provided, it defaults to creating a pair
         of both elements.

             [1, 2, 3].zip [4, 5, 6] == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
    zip : Vector Any -> (Any -> Any -> Any) -> Vector Any
    zip that function=[_,_] =
        len = Math.min this.length that.length
        here.new len i-> function (this.unsafe_at i) (that.unsafe_at i)

    ## Extend `this` vector to the length of `n` appending elements `elem` to
       the end.

       Arguments:
       - n: The length to pad `this` out to.
       - elem: The element to fill the new padded slots with.

       If the new length `n` is less than existing length, `this` vector is
       returned.

       > Example
         Extending vector to the length of 5 returns `[1, 2, 3, 0, 0]`

             [1, 2, 3].pad 5 0

       > Example
         Extending vector to the length of 5 returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].pad 5 0
    pad : Integer -> Any -> Vector Any
    pad n elem =
        if this.length >= n then this else
            this + (here.fill n-this.length elem)

    ## Vector to JSON conversion.

       > Example
         Convert a vector of numbers to JSON.

             [1, 2, 3].to_json
    to_json : Json.Array
    to_json = Json.Array (this.map .to_json)

    ## Get the first element from the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector
       is empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 1.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].head
    head : Any ! Empty_Error
    head = if this.length >= 1 then this.unsafe_at 0 else Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get all elements in the vector except the first.

       > Example
         The following code returns [2, 3, 4].

             [1, 2, 3, 4].tail
    tail : Vector ! Empty_Error
    tail = if this.length >= 1 then this.drop_start 1 else
        Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the all elements in the vector except the last.

       > Example
         The following code returns [1, 2, 3].

             [1, 2, 3, 4].init
    init : Vector ! Empty_Error
    init = if this.length >= 1 then this.drop_end 1 else Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the last element of the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector is
       empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 4.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].last
    last : Vector ! Empty_Error
    last = if this.length >= 1 then this.unsafe_at (this.length-1) else
        Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the first element from the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector
       is empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 1.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].first
    first : Vector ! Empty_Error
    first = this.head

    ## Get the second element from the vector, or a `Singleton_Error` if the
       vector doesn't have a second element.

       Useful when tuples are implemented as vectors.

       > Example
         The following code returns 2.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].second
    second : Vector ! Singleton_Error
    second = if this.length >= 2 then this.unsafe_at 1 else
        Error.throw (Singleton_Error this)

    ## Get all elements in the vector except the first.

       > Example
         The following code returns [2, 3, 4].
             [1, 2, 3, 4].rest
    rest : Vector ! Empty_Error
    rest = this.tail

    ## Sort the Vector.

       Arguments:
       - on: A projection from the element type to the value of that element
         being sorted on.
       - by: A function that compares the result of applying `on` to two
         elements, returning an Ordering to compare them.
       - order: The order in which the vector elements are sorted.

       By default, elements are sorted in ascending order, using the comparator
       `compare_to`. A custom comparator may be passed to the sort function.

       This is a stable sort, meaning that items that compare the same will not
       have their order changed by the sorting process.

       ! Computational Complexity
         The complexities for this sort are:
         - *Worst-Case Time:* `O(n * log n)`
         - *Best-Case Time:* `O(n)`
         - *Average Time:* `O(n * log n)`
         - *Worst-Case Space:* `O(n)` additional

       ? Implementation Note
         The sort implementation is based upon an adaptive, iterative mergesort
         that requires far fewer than `n * log(n)` comparisons when the vector
         is partially sorted. When the vector is randomly ordered, the
         performance is equivalent to a standard mergesort.

         It takes equal advantage of ascending and descending runs in the array,
         making it much simpler to merge two or more sorted arrays: simply
         concatenate them and sort.

       > Example
         Sorting a vector of numbers.

             [5, 2, 3, 45, 15].sort == [2, 3, 5, 15, 45]

       > Example
         Sorting a vector of `Pair`s on the first element, descending.

             [Pair 1 2, Pair -1 8].sort (_.first) (order = Sort_Order.Descending)
    sort : (Any -> Any) -> (Any -> Any -> Ordering) -> Sort_Order -> Vector Any
    sort (on = x -> x) (by = (_.compare_to _)) (order = Sort_Order.Ascending) =
        ## Prepare the destination array that will underlie the vector. We do
           not want to sort in place on the original vector, as `sort` is not
           intended to be mutable.
        new_vec_arr = Array.new this.length
        Array.copy this.to_array 0 new_vec_arr 0 this.length

        ## As we want to account for both custom projections and custom
           comparisons we need to construct a comparator for internal use that
           does both.
        comp_ascending l r  = by (on l) (on r)
        comp_descending l r = by (on r) (on l)
        compare = if order == Sort_Order.Ascending then comp_ascending else
            comp_descending

        new_vec_arr.sort compare

        Vector new_vec_arr

    ## UNSTABLE
       Keeps only unique elements within the Vector, removing any duplicates.

       Arguments:
       - on: A projection from the element type to the value of that element
             which determines the uniqueness criteria.

       The returned unique elements are kept in the same order as they appeared
       in the input.

       Out of multiple equivalent (equal up to the `on` projection) elements,
       always the one appearing first in the input is kept.

       > Example
         Removing repeating entries.

             [1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1] . distinct == [1, 3, 2]

       > Example
         Keeping only pairs whose first elements are unique.

             [Pair 1 "a", Pair 2 "b", Pair 1 "c"] . distinct (on = _.first) == [Pair 1 "a", Pair 2 "b"]
    distinct : (Any -> Any) -> Vector Any
    distinct (on = x->x) =
        ## TODO [JD] This is based on the Map class until a HashMap is available.

           Current implementation allows for a consistent distinct with the Enso `==` operator.
           Using the Map, is less efficient than a HashMap based as requires searching the tree (O(Log N)).
           A HashMap would allow for a O(1) operation to confirm if an item has been seen already.
           There is no native HashMap within Enso at present, and the polyglot approach does not produce
           consistent results with the `==` operator.

type Builder

    ## PRIVATE

       A builder type for Enso vectors.

       Arguments:
       - to_array: The accumulator for the new vector.
       - length: The current length of the vector being built.

       A vector builder is a mutable data structure, that allows to gather a
       number of elements and then convert them to a vector. This is
       particularly useful when the number of elements is not known upfront.

       > Example
         In the following example we'll read items from the standard input,
         until the string "end" is entered by the user and then return a vector
         containing all items.

             Construct a vector using a builder that contains the items 1 to 10.

                 example_new_builder =
                     do_build builder start stop =
                         new_builder = builder.append start
                         if start >= stop then new_builder else
                             @Tail_Call do_build new_builder start+1 stop
                     builder = do_build Vector.new_builder 1 10
                     builder.to_vector
    type Builder to_array length

    ## Creates a new builder.

       > Example
         Make a new builder

             Vector.new_builder
    new : Builder
    new = Builder (Array.new 1) 0

    ## Returns the current capacity (i.e. the size of the underlying storage)
       of this builder.

       > Example
         Get the capacity of a new builder.

             Vector.new_builder.capacity
    capacity : Integer
    capacity = this.to_array.length

    ## Checks if this builder is empty.

       > Example
         Checking for emptiness.

             [].is_empty
    is_empty : Boolean
    is_empty = this.length == 0

    ## Appends a new element into this builder and returns it, propagating any
       errors that the provided element could have contained.

       Arguments:
       - item: The item to append to the vector builder.

       > Example
         Append two items.

             builder = Vector.new_builder
             builder . append 10 . append 20
    append : Any ! Error -> Builder ! Error
    append item = case item of
        _ ->
            this.unsafe_append item
            this

    ## PRIVATE
       Appends a new element into this builder.

       ? Propagating Dataflow Errors
         Since this is an imperative operation which returns Nothing, if the
         item to be appended contained a dataflow error, the operation will fail
         and unless its result is inspected, the error can very easily be
         ignored. To avoid this, prefer to use the `append` operation and
         consume the returned builder which will contain any dataflow errors if
         they need to be propagated.

       Arguments:
       - item: The item to append to the vector builder.

       > Example
         Append an item to a vector builder.

             Vector.new_builder.unsafe_append 10
    unsafe_append : Any -> Nothing
    unsafe_append item = case this.capacity > this.length of
        True ->
            this.to_array.set_at this.length item
            Unsafe.set_atom_field this 1 (this.length + 1)
        False ->
            old_array = this.to_array
            new_array = Array.new old_array.length*2
            Array.copy old_array 0 new_array 0 old_array.length
            Unsafe.set_atom_field this 0 new_array
            this.append item
            Nothing

    ## Checks whether a predicate holds for at least one element of this builder.

       Arguments:
       - predicate: A function that takes a list element and returns a boolean
         that says whether that value satisfies the conditions of the function.

    exists : (Any -> Boolean) -> Boolean
    exists predicate =
        0.up_to this.length . exists (idx -> (predicate (this.to_array.at idx)))

    ## Converts this builder to a vector containing all the appended elements.

       > Example
         Use a builder to add elements to and then create a vector.

            example_to_vector =
                bldr = Vector.new_builder
                bldr.append 1
