##  The basic, immutable, vector type.
    A vector allows to store an arbitrary number of elements, in linear memory.
    It is the recommended data structure for most applications.

    > Example
      A vector containing the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`, in this order is:
          [1, 2, 3]

    > Example
      A vector containing 50 elements, each being the number `42`, can be
      created by:
          Vector.fill length=50 item=42

@Builtin_Type
type Vector a

       the provided constructor function.

       Arguments:
       - length: The length of the vector (>= 0).

    prepend : Any -> Vector Any
    prepend self element = [element] + self

    ## Add `element` to the end of `self` vector.

       Arguments:

    ## When `self` is a vector of text values, concatenates all the values by

    ## PRIVATE
       Creates a new vector with the skipping elements until `start` and then
       continuing until `end` index.

       Arguments:
       - start: The index of the first element to include.
       - end: The index to stop slicing at.

       > Example

    ## Creates a new vector with only the specified range of elements from the
       input, removing any elements outside the range.

       Arguments:
       - range: The section of the this Vector to return.
         If an `Index_Sub_Range`, then the selection is interpreted following
         the rules of that type.
         If a `Range`, the selection is specified by two indices, from and to.

        ## We are using a specialized implementation for `take Sample`, because
           the default implementation (which needs to be generic for any

       Arguments:
       - range: The section of the this Vector to return.
         If an `Index_Sub_Range`, then the selection is interpreted following
         the rules of that type.
         If a `Range`, the selection is specified by two indices, from and to.

    ## Performs a pair-wise operation passed in `function` on consecutive
       elements of `self` and `that`.

       Arguments:
       - that: The vector to zip with `self`.
       - function: The function used to combine pairwise elements of `self` and
         `that`.

       The result of this function is a vector of length being the shorter of
       `self` and `that`, containing results of calling `function`.

       > Example
         Calculate the pairwise sum of two vectors.

             [1, 2, 3].zip [4, 5, 6] (+)

       > Example
         When the `function` is not provided, it defaults to creating a pair
         of both elements.

             [1, 2, 3].zip [4, 5, 6] == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]

    ## Extend `self` vector to the length of `n` appending elements `elem` to
       the end.

       Arguments:
       - n: The length to pad `self` out to.
       - elem: The element to fill the new padded slots with.

       If the new length `n` is less than existing length, `self` vector is
       returned.

       > Example
         Extending vector to the length of 5 returns `[1, 2, 3, 0, 0]`

             [1, 2, 3].pad 5 0

       > Example
         Extending vector to the length of 5 returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

             [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].pad 5 0
    pad : Integer -> Any -> Vector Any
    pad self n elem =
        if self.length >= n then self else
            self + (Vector.fill n-self.length elem)

    ## Vector to JSON conversion.

       > Example
         Convert a vector of numbers to JSON.

             [1, 2, 3].to_json
    to_json : Json
    to_json self = Json.Array (self.map .to_json)

    ## Get the first element from the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector
       is empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 1.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].head
    head : Any ! Empty_Error
    head self = if self.length >= 1 then self.at 0 else Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get all elements in the vector except the first.

       > Example
         The following code returns [2, 3, 4].

             [1, 2, 3, 4].tail
    tail : Vector ! Empty_Error
    tail self = if self.length >= 1 then self.drop (Index_Sub_Range.First 1) else
        Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the all elements in the vector except the last.

       > Example
         The following code returns [1, 2, 3].

             [1, 2, 3, 4].init
    init : Vector ! Empty_Error
    init self = if self.length >= 1 then self.drop (Index_Sub_Range.Last 1) else Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the last element of the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector is
       empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 4.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].last
    last : Vector ! Empty_Error
    last self = if self.length >= 1 then self.at (self.length-1) else
        Error.throw Empty_Error

    ## Get the first element from the vector, or an `Empty_Error` if the vector
       is empty.

       > Example
         The following code returns 1.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].first
    first : Vector ! Empty_Error
    first self = self.head

    ## Get the second element from the vector, or a `Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error` if the
       vector doesn't have a second element.

       Useful when tuples are implemented as vectors.

       > Example
         The following code returns 2.

             [1, 2, 3, 4].second
    second : Vector ! Index_Out_Of_Bounds_Error
    second self = self.at 1

    ## Get all elements in the vector except the first.

       > Example
         The following code returns [2, 3, 4].
             [1, 2, 3, 4].rest
    rest : Vector ! Empty_Error
    rest self = self.tail

    ## Sort the Vector.

       Arguments:
       - on: A projection from the element type to the value of that element
         being sorted on.
       - by: A function that compares the result of applying `on` to two
         elements, returning an Ordering to compare them.
       - order: The order in which the vector elements are sorted.

       By default, elements are sorted in ascending order, using the comparator
       `compare_to`. A custom comparator may be passed to the sort function.

       This is a stable sort, meaning that items that compare the same will not
       have their order changed by the sorting process.

       ! Computational Complexity
         The complexities for this sort are:
         - *Worst-Case Time:* `O(n * log n)`
         - *Best-Case Time:* `O(n)`
         - *Average Time:* `O(n * log n)`
         - *Worst-Case Space:* `O(n)` additional

       ? Implementation Note
         The sort implementation is based upon an adaptive, iterative mergesort
         that requires far fewer than `n * log(n)` comparisons when the vector
         is partially sorted. When the vector is randomly ordered, the
         performance is equivalent to a standard mergesort.

         It takes equal advantage of ascending and descending runs in the array,
         making it much simpler to merge two or more sorted arrays: simply
         concatenate them and sort.

       > Example
         Sorting a vector of numbers.

             [5, 2, 3, 45, 15].sort == [2, 3, 5, 15, 45]

       > Example
         Sorting a vector of `Pair`s on the first element, descending.

             [Pair 1 2, Pair -1 8].sort (_.first) (order = Sort_Direction.Descending)
    sort : (Any -> Any) -> (Any -> Any -> Ordering) -> Sort_Direction -> Vector Any ! Incomparable_Values_Error
    sort self (on = x -> x) (by = (_.compare_to _)) (order = Sort_Direction.Ascending) =
        ## Prepare the destination array that will underlie the vector. We do
           not want to sort in place on the original vector, as `sort` is not
           intended to be mutable.
        new_vec_arr = Array.new self.length
        Array.copy self.to_array 0 new_vec_arr 0 self.length

        ## As we want to account for both custom projections and custom
           comparisons we need to construct a comparator for internal use that
           does both.
        comp_ascending l r  = by (on l) (on r)
        comp_descending l r = by (on r) (on l)
        compare = if order == Sort_Direction.Ascending then comp_ascending else
            comp_descending

    ## UNSTABLE
       Keeps only unique elements within the Vector, removing any duplicates.

       Arguments:
       - on: A projection from the element type to the value of that element
             which determines the uniqueness criteria.

       The returned unique elements are kept in the same order as they appeared
       in the input.

       Out of multiple equivalent (equal up to the `on` projection) elements,
       always the one appearing first in the input is kept.

       > Example
         Removing repeating entries.

             [1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1] . distinct == [1, 3, 2]

       > Example
         Keeping only pairs whose first elements are unique.

             [Pair 1 "a", Pair 2 "b", Pair 1 "c"] . distinct (on = _.first) == [Pair 1 "a", Pair 2 "b"]
    distinct : (Any -> Any) -> Vector Any
    distinct self (on = x->x) =
        ## TODO [JD] This is based on the Map class until a HashMap is available.

           Current implementation allows for a consistent distinct with the Enso `==` operator.
           Using the Map, is less efficient than a HashMap based as requires searching the tree (O(Log N)).
           A HashMap would allow for a O(1) operation to confirm if an item has been seen already.
           There is no native HashMap within Enso at present, and the polyglot approach does not produce
           consistent results with the `==` operator.

type Builder

    ## PRIVATE

       A builder type for Enso vectors.

       Arguments:
       - java_builder: The accumulator for the new vector.

       A vector builder is a mutable data structure, that allows to gather a
       number of elements and then convert them to a vector. This is
       particularly useful when the number of elements is not known upfront.

       > Example
         In the following example we'll read items from the standard input,
         until the string "end" is entered by the user and then return a vector
         containing all items.

             Construct a vector using a builder that contains the items 1 to 10.

                 example_new_builder =
                     do_build builder start stop =
                         new_builder = builder.append start
                         if start >= stop then new_builder else
                             @Tail_Call do_build new_builder start+1 stop
                     builder = do_build Vector.new_builder 1 10
                     builder.to_vector

       ! TODO
         We may want to revisit the fold pattern - it is required for correct
         propagation of dataflow errors, but it is very easy to forget about it
         and get wrong error propagation. Instead we may want to have a `Ref`
         inside of the Builder. Any error detected during `append` could set
         that `Ref` and then `to_vector` could propagate that error.
    Value java_builder

    ## Creates a new builder.

       Arguments:
       - capacity: Initial capacity of the Vector.Builder

       > Example
         Make a new builder

             Vector.new_builder
    new : Integer -> Builder
    new (capacity=10) = Builder.Value (Array_Builder.newBuilder capacity)

    ## Checks if this builder is empty.
    is_empty : Boolean
    is_empty self = self.java_builder.isEmpty

    ## Checks if this builder is not empty.
    not_empty : Boolean
    not_empty self = self.is_empty.not

    ## Appends a new element into this builder and returns it, propagating any
       errors that the provided element could have contained.

       Arguments:
       - item: The item to append to the vector builder.

       > Example
         Append two items.

             builder = Vector.new_builder
             builder . append 10 . append 20
    append : Any ! Error -> Builder ! Error
    append self item = case item of
        _ ->
            self.unsafe_append item
            self

    ## Appends a part of a given vector to this builder

       Arguments:
       - vector: The vector from which the elements are sourced.
       - start: The start index of the range to append.
       - end: The end index (the first index after the last element to be
         appended) of the range to be appended.

       > Example
         Append a part of the vector.

             builder = Vector.new_builder
             builder . append_vector_range [20, 30, 40, 50] 1 3 . to_vector == [30, 40]

    append_vector_range self vector start end =
        subrange = vector.slice start end
        ## This workaround is needed because
           `self.java_builder.addAll subrange.to_array` fails with
           `Unsupported argument types: [Array]`.
        self.java_builder.appendTo subrange.to_array

    ## PRIVATE
       Appends a new element into this builder.

       ? Propagating Dataflow Errors
         Since this is an imperative operation which returns Nothing, if the
         item to be appended contained a dataflow error, the operation will fail
         and unless its result is inspected, the error can very easily be
         ignored. To avoid this, prefer to use the `append` operation and
         consume the returned builder which will contain any dataflow errors if
         they need to be propagated.

       Arguments:
       - item: The item to append to the vector builder.

       > Example
         Append an item to a vector builder.

    ## Checks whether a predicate holds for at least one element of this builder.

       Arguments:
       - predicate: A function that takes a list element and returns a boolean
         that says whether that value satisfies the conditions of the function.

    exists : (Any -> Boolean) -> Boolean
    exists self predicate =
