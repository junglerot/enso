## Obtains the current time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

   > Example
     Get the current time in the default time zone.

         import Standard.Base.Data.Time.Time_Of_Day

         example_now = Time_Of_Day.now
now : Time_Of_Day
now = @Builtin_Method "Time_Of_Day.now"

## Obtains an instance of `Time_Of_Day` from an hour, minute, second
   and nanosecond.

   Arguments:
   - hour: The hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23.
   - minute: The minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59.
   - second: The second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59.
   - nanosecond: The nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999.

   Returns a `Time_Error` if the provided time is not a valid time.

   > Example
     Create a new local time at Unix epoch.

         import Standard.Base.Data.Time.Time_Of_Day

         example_epoch = Time_Of_Day.new

   > Example
     Get the local time at 9:30.

    Panic.catch_java Any (Time_Of_Day.new_builtin hour minute second nanosecond) java_exception->
        Error.throw (Time.Time_Error java_exception.getMessage)

## Obtains an instance of `Time_Of_Day` from a text such as "10:15".

   Arguments:
   - text: The text to parse as a time of day.
   - pattern: The pattern to use for parsing the input text.
   - locale: The locale in which the pattern should be interpreted.

   Returns a `Time_Error` if the provided text cannot be parsed using the
   default format.

   ? Pattern Syntax
     For the list of accepted symbols in pattern refer to `Time.format` doc.

   ? Default Time Format
     The text must represent a valid time and is parsed using the ISO-8601
     extended local time format. The format consists of:

     - Two digits for the hour-of-day. This is pre-padded by zero to ensure two
       digits.
     - A colon
     - Two digits for the minute-of-hour. This is pre-padded by zero to ensure
       two digits.
     - If the second-of-minute is not available then the format is complete.
     - A colon
     - Two digits for the second-of-minute. This is pre-padded by zero to ensure
       two digits.
     - If the nano-of-second is zero or not available then the format is
       complete.
     - A decimal point
     - One to nine digits for the nano-of-second. As many digits will be output
       as required.

   > Example
     Get the time 15:05:30.

         import Standard.Base.Data.Time.Time_Of_Day

         example_parse = Time_Of_Day.parse "15:05:30"

         import Standard.Base.Data.Time.Time_Of_Day

         example_parse = Time_Of_Day.parse "04:30:20" "HH:mm:ss"

   > Example
     Parse "4:30AM" as Time_Of_Day

type Time_Of_Day

    ## PRIVATE

       This type is a date-time object that represents a time, often viewed
       as hour-minute-second.

       Time is represented to nanosecond precision. For example, the value
       "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a `Time_Of_Day`.
