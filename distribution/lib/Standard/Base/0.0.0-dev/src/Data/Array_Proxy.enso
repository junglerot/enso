## A helper type used for creating an array from a length and a callback
   providing its elements.

   It can be used to create an array from some non-standard underlying storage
   without copying. The created proxy is read only and behaves like any `Array`
   type returned from polyglot calls to other languages. The most common
   use-case for it is to pass it to `Vector.from_polyglot_array` to create a
   vector backed by such custom storage.
@Builtin_Type
type Array_Proxy
    ## ADVANCED
       UNSTABLE
       Creates a new `Array_Proxy` from a length and a callback.

       Arguments:
       - length: The length of the array to create.
       - at: A function which returns each element of the array.

       > Example
         Create a Vector of 10 million elements without allocating any storage.

             Vector.from_polyglot_array (Array_Proxy.new 10000000 (i -> i))
    new : Integer -> (Integer -> Any) -> Array
    new length at = @Builtin_Method "Array_Proxy.new"

    ## ADVANCED
       UNSTABLE
       Creates a new `Array_Proxy` from an object providing `length` and `at`
       methods.
    from_proxy_object : Any -> Array
    from_proxy_object proxy =
        Array_Proxy.new proxy.length proxy.at
