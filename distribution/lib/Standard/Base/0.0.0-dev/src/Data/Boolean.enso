## A type with only two possible values.

   The boolean type represents the two truth values of boolean logic. It is
   primarily used for control-flow.
@Builtin_Type
type Boolean
    True
    False

    ## Compares two booleans for equality.

       Arguments:
       - that: The boolean to compare this with.

       > Example
         Comparing True to False to get False.

             True == False
    == : Boolean -> Boolean
    == self that = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.=="

    ## Computes the logical and (conjunction) of two booleans.

       Arguments:
       - that: The boolean to compute the conjunction of this with.

       ! Short Circuiting
         This method is implemented in a short-circuiting manner. This means
         that if this is False, it will no longer evaluate that.

       > Example
         Computing the conjunction of False and True (to get False).

             False && True
    && : Boolean -> Boolean
    && self ~that = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.&&"

    ## Computes the logical or (disjunction) of two booleans.

       Arguments:
       - that: The boolean to compute the disjunction of this with.

       ! Short Circuiting
         This method is implemented in a short-circuiting manner. This means
         that if this is True, it will no longer evaluate that.

       > Example
         Computing the disjunction of True and False (to get True).

             True || False
    || : Boolean -> Boolean
    || self ~that = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.||"

    ## Computes the logical negation of this.

       > Example
         Negating True to get False.

             True.not
    not : Boolean
    not self = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.not"

    ## Compares the two operands to determine the ordering of this with
       respect to that.

       Arguments:
       - that: The operand to order this with respect to.

       > Example
         Computing the ordering of True and False

             True.compare_to False
    compare_to : Boolean -> Ordering
    compare_to self that = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.compare_to"

    ## The if-then-else control flow operator that executes one of two branches
       based on a conditional.

       Arguments:
       - on_true: The computation to evaluate if this evaluates to True.
       - on_false: The computation to evaluate if this evaluates to False.

       Both of the arguments to this method are _lazy_, meaning that they will
       only be evaluated if they are needed (based on the condition).

       > Example
         Telling the user if a number 27 is divisible by three.

             if (27 % 3) == 0 then IO.println "Yes" else IO.println "No"
    if_then_else : Any -> Any -> Any
    if_then_else self ~on_true ~on_false = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.if_then_else"

    ## The if-then control flow operator that executes a branch if the condition
       is true, and otherwise returns Nothing.

       Arguments:
       - on_true: The computation to evaluate if this evaluates to True.

       The argument to this method is _lazy_, meaning that it will only be
       evaluated if the this evaluates to True.

       > Example
         Printing a message to the user only if a number is divisible by three.

             if (27 % 3) == 0 then IO.println "Fizz"
    if_then : Any -> Any | Nothing
    if_then self ~on_true = @Builtin_Method "Boolean.if_then"
