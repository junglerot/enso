## A description of how the regex engine will match on the content.

   This lets you configure how you want to match, from the `First` match only,
   to matching on the `Full` content of the input text.

import project.Data.Numbers.Integer
import project.Data.Text.Matching_Mode

type Regex_Mode
    ## The regex will make all possible matches.
    All

    ## The regex will only match if the _entire_ text matches.
    Full

    ## The regex will only match within the region defined by start..end.

       Arguments:
       - start: The inclusive start bound of the region.
       - end: The exclusive end bound of the region.
       - mode: The mode to use within the bounded region.

       ! Units
         The `start` and `end` indices range over _characters_ in the text. The
         precise definition of `character` is, for the moment, defined by the
         regular expression engine itself.
    Bounded (start : Integer) (end : Integer) (mode : (Matching_Mode.First | Matching_Mode.Last | Regex_Mode) = Regex_Mode.All)
