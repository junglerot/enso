## UNSTABLE
   An error indicating that some criteria did not match any names in the input.
type No_Matches_Found
    No_Matches_Found_Data (criteria : Vector Text)

No_Matches_Found.to_display_text : Text
No_Matches_Found.to_display_text self =
    "The criteria "+self.criteria.to_text+" did not match any names in the input."


## Represents case-insensitive comparison mode.

   Arguments:
   - locale: The locale used for the comparison.
type Case_Insensitive
    Case_Insensitive_Data locale=Locale.default

## Represents exact text matching mode.

   Arguments:
   - case_sensitive: Case Sensitive if True. Otherwise, the comparison is case
     insensitive using the specified locale.
type Text_Matcher
    Text_Matcher_Data (case_sensitive : (True | Case_Insensitive) = True)

## Represents regex matching mode.

   Arguments:
   - case_sensitive: Enables or disables case-insensitive matching. Case
     insensitive matching behaves as if it normalizes the case of all input text
     before matching on it.
   - multiline: Enables or disables the multiline option. Multiline specifies
     that the `^` and `$` pattern characters match the start and end of lines,
     as to well as the start and end of the input, respectively.
   - match_ascii: Enables or disables pure-ASCII matching for the regex. If you
     know your data only contains ASCII, you can enable this for a performance
     boost on some regex engines.
   - dot_matches_newline: Enables or disables the dot matches newline option.
     This specifies that the `.` special character should match everything
     _including_ newline characters. Without this flag, it matches all
     characters _except_ newlines.
   - comments: Enables or disables the comments mode for the regular expression.
     In comments mode, the following changes apply:
     - Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when within a character
       class or when preceded by an unescaped backslash, or within grouping
       constructs (e.g. `(?...)`).
     - When a line contains a `#` that is not in a character class and is not
       preceded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost such
       `#` to the end of the line are ignored. That is to say; they act as
       'comments' in the regex.
type Regex_Matcher
    Regex_Matcher_Data (case_sensitive : (True | Case_Insensitive) = True) (multiline : Boolean = False) (match_ascii : Boolean = False) (dot_matches_newline : Boolean = False) (comments : Boolean = False)

## UNSTABLE
   Checks if a name matches the provided criterion according to the specified
   matching strategy.

   Arguments:
   - name: A `Text` representing the name being matched.
   - criterion: A `Text` representing the name to be matched.

   > Example
     Check if the provided name matches a regular expression.

         Text_Matcher.match_single_criterion "Foobar" "foo" == False
Text_Matcher.match_single_criterion : Text -> Text -> Boolean
Text_Matcher.match_single_criterion self name criterion =
    case self.case_sensitive of
        True -> name == criterion
        Case_Insensitive_Data locale -> name.equals_ignore_case criterion locale=locale

## UNSTABLE
   Checks if a name matches the provided criterion according to the specified
   matching strategy.

   Arguments:
   - name: A `Text` representing the name being matched.
   - criterion: A `Text` representing the regular expression specifying the
     matching criterion.

   > Example
     Check if the provided name matches a regular expression.

         Regex_Matcher case_sensitive=Case_Insensitive . match_single_criterion "Foobar" "f.*" == True
Regex_Matcher.match_single_criterion : Text -> Text -> Boolean
Regex_Matcher.match_single_criterion self name criterion =
    self.compile criterion . matches name

## UNSTABLE
   Selects objects from an input list that match any of the provided criteria.

   Arguments:
   - objects: A list of objects to be matched.
   - criteria: A list of texts representing the matching criteria. Their meaning
     depends on the matching strategy.
   - reorder: Specifies whether to reorder the matched objects according to the
     order of the matching criteria.
     If `False`, the matched entries are returned in the same order as in the
     input.
     If `True`, the matched entries are returned in the order of the criteria
     matching them. If a single object has been matched by multiple criteria, it
     is placed in the group belonging to the first matching criterion on the
     list.
     If a single criterion's group has more than one element, their relative
     order is the same as in the input.
   - name_mapper: A function mapping a provided object to its name, which will
     then be matched with the criteria. It is set to the identity function by
     default, thus allowing the input to be a list of names to match. But it can
     be overridden to enable matching more complex objects.
   - matcher: A `Matcher` instance specifying how to interpret the criterion.
   - on_problems: Specifies the behavior when a problem occurs during the
     function.
     By default, a warning is issued, but the operation proceeds.
     If set to `Report_Error`, the operation fails with a dataflow error.
     If set to `Ignore`, the operation proceeds without errors or warnings.

   > Example
     Selects objects matching one of the provided patterns, preserving the input order.

         Regex_Matcher case_sensitive=True . match_criteria ["foo", "foobar", "quux", "baz", "Foo"] [".*ba.*", "f.*"] == ["foo", "foobar", "baz"]

   > Example
     Selects pairs matching their first element with the provided criteria and
     ordering the result according to the order of criteria that matched them.

         Text_Matcher.match_criteria [Pair_Data "foo" 42, Pair_Data "bar" 33, Pair_Data "baz" 10, Pair_Data "foo" 0, Pair_Data 10 10] ["bar", "foo"] reorder=True name_mapper=_.name == [Pair_Data "bar" 33, Pair_Data "foo" 42, Pair_Data "foo" 0]
