## Represents exact text matching mode.
type Text_Matcher
    ## Represents exact text matching mode.
    Case_Sensitive

    ## Represents case-insensitive text matching mode.
    Case_Insensitive (locale:Locale=Locale.default)

    ## UNSTABLE
       Checks if a name matches the provided criterion according to the specified
       matching strategy.

       Arguments:
       - name: A `Text` representing the name being matched.
       - criterion: A `Text` representing the name to be matched.

       > Example
         Check if the provided name matches a regular expression.

             Text_Matcher.match_single_criterion "Foobar" "foo" == False
    match_single_criterion : Text -> Text -> Boolean
    match_single_criterion self name criterion = case self of
        Text_Matcher.Case_Sensitive -> name == criterion
        Text_Matcher.Case_Insensitive locale -> name.equals_ignore_case criterion locale=locale

    ## UNSTABLE
       Selects objects from an input list that match any of the provided criteria.

       Arguments:
       - objects: A list of objects to be matched.
       - criteria: A list of texts representing the matching criteria. Their meaning
         depends on the matching strategy.
       - reorder: Specifies whether to reorder the matched objects according to the
         order of the matching criteria.
         If `False`, the matched entries are returned in the same order as in the
         input.
         If `True`, the matched entries are returned in the order of the criteria
         matching them. If a single object has been matched by multiple criteria, it
         is placed in the group belonging to the first matching criterion on the
         list.
         If a single criterion's group has more than one element, their relative
         order is the same as in the input.
       - name_mapper: A function mapping a provided object to its name, which will
         then be matched with the criteria. It is set to the identity function by
         default, thus allowing the input to be a list of names to match. But it can
         be overridden to enable matching more complex objects.
       - matcher: A `Matcher` instance specifying how to interpret the criterion.
       - on_problems: Specifies the behavior when a problem occurs during the
         function.
         By default, a warning is issued, but the operation proceeds.
         If set to `Report_Error`, the operation fails with a dataflow error.
         If set to `Ignore`, the operation proceeds without errors or warnings.

       > Example
         Selects objects matching one of the provided patterns, preserving the input order.

             Regex_Matcher.Regex_Matcher_Data case_sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Sensitive . match_criteria ["foo", "foobar", "quux", "baz", "Foo"] [".*ba.*", "f.*"] == ["foo", "foobar", "baz"]

       > Example
         Selects pairs matching their first element with the provided criteria and
         ordering the result according to the order of criteria that matched them.

             Text_Matcher.match_criteria [Pair.new "foo" 42, Pair.new "bar" 33, Pair.new "baz" 10, Pair.new "foo" 0, Pair.new 10 10] ["bar", "foo"] reorder=True name_mapper=_.name == [Pair.new "bar" 33, Pair.new "foo" 42, Pair.new "foo" 0]
