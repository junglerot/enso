     Creating a span over the first three characters of the text "hello!".

type Span

    ## A representation of a span of characters in Enso's `Text` type.

       Arguments:
       - range: The range of characters over which the span exists. The range is
         assumed to have `step` equal to 1.
       - text: The text over which the span exists.

       ! What is a Character?
         A character is defined as an Extended Grapheme Cluster, see Unicode
         Standard Annex 29. This is the smallest unit that still has semantic
         meaning in most text-processing applications.

       > Example
         Creating a span over the first three characters of the text "hello!".

             import Standard.Base.Data.Text.Span

             example_span =
                 text = "Hello!"

    ## The index of the first character included in the span.

    start : Integer

    ## Converts the span of extended grapheme clusters to a corresponding span
       of UTF-16 code units.

       > Example
         Find the span of code units corresponding to the span of extended grapheme clusters.

         text = 'ae\u{301}fz'
         (Span_Data (Range 1 3) text).to_utf_16_span == (Utf_16_Span_Data (Range 1 4) text)

type Utf_16_Span

    ## A representation of a span of UTF-16 code units in Enso's `Text` type.

       Arguments:
       - range: The range of code units over which the span exists. The range is
         assumed to have `step` equal to 1.
       - text: The text over which the span exists.

       > Example
         Creating a span over the first three code units of the text 'a\u{301}bc'.

             import Standard.Base.Data.Text.Span

             example_span =

    ## The index of the first code unit included in the span.
    start : Integer
    start self = self.range.start

    ## The index of the first code unit after `start` that is _not_ included in
       the span.
    end : Integer
    end self = self.range.end

    ## The length of the span in UTF-16 code units.
    length : Integer
    length self = self.range.length

    ## Returns a span of extended grapheme clusters which is the closest
       approximation of this span of code units.

       The resulting span is extended in such a way that every code unit that
       was contained by the original span is also contained in a new span. Since
       some grapheme clusters consist of multiple code units, after the span was
       extended it may also contain code units which were not contained inside
       of the original span.

         Convert a codepoint span to graphemes and back.
