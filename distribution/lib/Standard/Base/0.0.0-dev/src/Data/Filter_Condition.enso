type Filter_Condition
    ## Is less than a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Less than:Any

    ## Is less than or equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal_Or_Less than:Any

    ## Is equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal to:Any

    ## Is greater than or equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Equal_Or_Greater than:Any

    ## Is greater than a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Greater than:Any

    ## Is not equal to a value (or another column, in case of Table operations)?
    Not_Equal to:Any

    ## Is between (inclusive) two values (or columns, in case of Table operations)?
    Between lower:Any upper:Any

    ## Does the value start with a prefix (Text only)?

       It accepts a Text value to check if the value starts with it. In case of
       Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
       values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Starts_With (prefix:Text)

    ## Does the value end with a suffix (Text only)?

       It accepts a Text value to check if the value ends with it. In case of
       Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
       values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Ends_With (suffix:Text)

    ## Does the value contain the needle (Text only)?

       It accepts a Text value to check if the value contains it. In case of
       Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
       values from the source column and the provided column are checked.
    Contains (substring:Text)

    ## Is equal to Nothing?
    Is_Nothing

    ## Is not equal to Nothing?
    Not_Nothing

    ## Is the value equal to True (Boolean only)?
    Is_True

    ## Is the value equal to False (Boolean only)?
    Is_False

    ## Is equal to "" or Nothing (Text only)?
    Is_Empty

    ## Is not equal to "" and Nothing (Text only)?
    Not_Empty

    ## Does the value match the SQL pattern (Text only)?

       It accepts a Text value representing the matching pattern. In case of
       Table operations, it can accept another column - then the corresponding
       values from the source column and the provided column are checked.

       The pattern is interpreted according to the standard SQL convention:
       - the `%` character matches any sequence of characters,
       - the `_` character matches any single character,
       - any other character is matched literally.

       ! Known Bugs
         There is a known bug in Java Regex where escape characters are not
         handled properly in Unicode-normalized matching mode. Due to this
         limitation, Unicode normalization has been disabled for this function,
         so beware that some equivalent graphemes like 'ś' and 's\u0301' will
         not be matched.
