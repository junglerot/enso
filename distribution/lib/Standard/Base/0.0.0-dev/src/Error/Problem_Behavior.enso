       Attaches a problem to the given value according to the expected problem
       behavior.

       If the problem behavior is set to Ignore, the value is returned as-is.
       If it is set to Report_Warning, the value is returned with the problem
       attached as a warning.
       If it is set to Report_Error, the problem is returned in the form of a
       dataflow error. If the value already contained any dataflow error, that
       error takes precedence.

       Attaches a problem to the given value according to the expected problem

       Attaches problems to the given value according to the expected problem
       behavior.

       If the problem behavior is set to Ignore, the value is returned as-is.
       If it is set to Report_Warning, the value is returned with the problems
       attached as warnings.
       If it is set to Report_Error, the first problem is returned in the form
       of a dataflow error. The problem takes precedence over any errors that
       may have been contained in the value - in this case the `decorated_value`
       is not computed at all.

       > Example
         Perform pre-flight checks and then compute the actual result only if needed.

       Attaches problems to the given value according to the expected problem

       If it is set to Report_Warning, the value is returned with the problems

       of a dataflow error. If the value already contained any dataflow error,
       that error takes precedence.

       > Example

         perform any postprocessing checks which may raise warnings/errors.

    ## ADVANCED
       UNSTABLE
       A helper method that will handle any errors contained within the result
       according to the current problem behavior settings. If the `result` does
       not contain an error, it is returned as-is. Otherwise, if the problem
       behavior is `Report_Error`, the error will be passed as-is. If it is
       `Report_Warning`, the error is turned into a warning, and the fallback
       value is returned with that error attached to it as a warning. If it is
       `Ignore`, the fallback value is returned and the error is discarded.

       The `error_type` parameter can be overridden to catch only some types of
       errors. By default `Any` error is caught.
    handle_errors : Any -> Any -> Any -> Any
    handle_errors self result ~fallback error_type=Any = result.catch error_type error-> case self of
        Ignore -> fallback
        Report_Warning -> Warning.attach error fallback
        Report_Error -> result

    ## ADVANCED
       Checks any warnings reported by the `action` and reports them according
       to this problem behavior - they may be kept as-is, ignored or escalated
       to errors.

       If the `action` itself yields a dataflow error, that error is passed
       as-is, regardless of the problem behavior settings.
    escalate_warnings self ~action =
        result = action
        warnings = Warning.get_all result . map .value
