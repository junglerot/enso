## Utilities for interacting with the runtime.

## PRIVATE

   Returns a raw representation of the current execution stack trace.
   You probably want `Runtime.get_stack_trace` instead.
primitive_get_stack_trace : Array
primitive_get_stack_trace = @Builtin_Method "Runtime.primitive_get_stack_trace"

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

   Returns the execution stack trace of its call site. The ordering of the
   resulting vector is such that the top stack frame is the first element.
get_stack_trace : Vector.Vector Stack_Trace_Element
get_stack_trace =
    prim_stack = this.primitive_get_stack_trace
    stack_with_prims = Vector.Vector prim_stack
    stack = stack_with_prims.map here.wrap_primitive_stack_trace_element
    # drop this frame and the one from `Runtime.primitive_get_stack_trace`
    stack.drop_start 2

## ADVANCED

   Suggests that the runtime perform garbage collection.

   It is not _guaranteed_ to perform garbage collection, but in practice
   will _usually_ begin a garbage collection cycle.

   > Example
     Ask for the runtime to collect garbage.

         Runtime.gc
gc : Nothing
gc = @Builtin_Method "Runtime.gc"

## ADVANCED

   Executes the provided action without allowing it to inline.

   Arguments:
   - action: The computation to be executed.

   This is particularly useful when writing benchmarks and
   performance-critical code where you need to prevent inlining from
   occurring.

   > Example
     Print something to the console without it being inlined.

         Runtime.no_inline <| IO.println "Hi!"
no_inline : Any -> Any
no_inline ~action = @Builtin_Method "Runtime.no_inline"

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

   Applies the following function to the given argument, without allowing
   them to inline.

   Arguments:
   - function: The one-argument function to call.
   - arg: The single argument for the function.

   This is particularly useful to avoid constant folding in benchmarks.

   > Example
     Print something to the console without it being inlined.

         Runtime.no_inline_with_arg IO.println "Hi!"
no_inline_with_arg : Any -> Any
no_inline_with_arg function arg = @Builtin_Method "Runtime.no_inline_with_arg"

## PRIVATE
   Converts a primitive stack trace element into the regular one.
wrap_primitive_stack_trace_element el =
    loc = if Polyglot.has_source_location el then (Source_Location (Polyglot.get_source_location el)) else Nothing
    name = Polyglot.get_executable_name el
    Stack_Trace_Element name loc

## ADVANCED
   UNSTABLE

   Represents a single stack frame in an Enso stack trace.
type Stack_Trace_Element
    ## PRIVATE
    type Stack_Trace_Element name source_location
