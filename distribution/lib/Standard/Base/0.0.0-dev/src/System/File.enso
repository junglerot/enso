## ALIAS New File

   Creates a new file object, pointing to the given path.

   Arguments:
   - path: The path to the file that you want to create, or a file itself. The
     latter is a no-op.

   > Example
     Create a new file pointing to the `data.csv` file in the project directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File
         import Standard.Examples

         example_new = File.new Examples.csv_path
new : (Text | File) -> File
new path =
  case path of
    Text -> get_file path
    File -> path
    _    -> Error.throw (Illegal_Argument_Error_Data "new file should be either a File or a Text")

## Open and reads all bytes in the file at the provided `path` into a byte vector.

   Arguments:
   - path: The path of the file to open and read the contents of. It will
     accept a textual path or a file.

   > Example
     Read all of the bytes in the file.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_read_bytes = File.read_bytes Examples.csv
read_bytes : (Text | File) -> Vector.Vector ! File_Error
read_bytes path =
    file = new path
    file.read_bytes

## Open and read the file at the provided `path`.

   Arguments:
   - path: The path of the file to open and read the contents of. It will
     accept a textual path or a file.
   - encoding: The text encoding to decode the file with. Defaults to UTF-8.
   - on_problems: Specifies the behavior when a problem occurs during the
     function.
     By default, a warning is issued, but the operation proceeds.
     If set to `Report_Error`, the operation fails with a dataflow error.
     If set to `Ignore`, the operation proceeds without errors or warnings.

   ? Module or Instance?
     If you have a variable `file` of type `File`, we recommend calling the
     `.read_text` method on it directly, rather than using
     `File.read_text file`. The later, however, will still work.

   > Example
     Read the `data.csv` file in the project directory's `data` directory. You
     will need to create the file `data.csv` manually in that directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File
         import Standard.Examples

         example_read = File.read_text Examples.csv_path
read_text : (Text | File) -> Encoding -> Problem_Behavior -> Text
read_text path (encoding=Encoding.utf_8) (on_problems=Report_Warning) =
    file = new path
    file.read_text encoding on_problems

## ALIAS Current Directory

   Returns the current working directory (CWD) of the current program.

   > Example
     Get the program's current working directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File

         example_cwd = File.current_directory
current_directory : File
current_directory = get_cwd

## ALIAS Home Directory

   Returns the home directory of the current user.

   > Example
     Get the current user's home directory.

         import Standard.Base.System.File

         example_home = File.home
home : File
home = @Builtin_Method "File.home"

## Lists files contained in the provided directory.

   Arguments:
   - name_filter: A glob pattern that can be used to filter the returned files.
     If it is not specified, all files are returned.
   - recursive: Specifies whether the returned list of files should include also
     files from the subdirectories. If set to `False` (the default), only the
     immediate children of the listed directory are considered.

   The `name_filter` can contain the following special characters:
   - `"?"` - which matches a single filename character (so it will not match a
     `"/"`).
   - `"*"` - which matches any number of characters, but again does not cross
     directories.
   - `"**"` - which matches any number of characters and can cross directories.
   - `"\"` - can be used to escape the characters with special meaning; to get a
     single backslash, you need to specify it twice; you also need to keep in
     mind that the interpolating string literal also uses `"\"` as an escape
     sequence, so you need to type `'\\\\'` to get a single backslash for the
     glob pattern, unless you use the raw strings, where you only need to escape
     once: `"\\"`.
   - Brackets can be used to match exactly one character from some set of
     characters. For example `"[xy]"` matches `"x"` or `"y"`. Character ranges
     can also be specified: `"[a-z]"` matches any character from `"a"` to `"z"`.
     An exclamation mark can be used to negate the match, i.e. `"[!xz]"` will
     match any characters except for `"x"` and `"z"`. Moreover the ranges and
     single characters can be used together, so for example `"[a-cxy]"` will
     match `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"x"` or `"y"`. Within the brackets, the special
     characters `"*"`, `"?"` and `"\"` stand for themselves instead of their
     special meanings.
   - Braces allow to specify multiple patterns (separated with a comma), one of
     which must be matched. For example: `"{abc,x*}"` will match either the name
     `"abc"` or any name starting with `"x"`. The groups cannot be nested.

   Keep in mind that if `recursive` is set to True and a `name_filter` is used,
   the function will return files from subdirectories only if the set
   `name_filter` allows crossing directories. So even with `recursive=True` a
   filter `"*.txt"` will only return files that are immediate children of the
   listed directory, to list files recursively you need to use a filter like
   `"**.txt"` or `"*/*"` (which will match only files that are exactly one
   directory down from the listed directory) or no filter at all.

   > Example
     List all files with `.md` extension in the example directory and any of its
     subdirectories.

         import Standard.Examples

         example_list_files =
             File.list Examples.data_dir name_filter="**.md" recursive=True
list : (File | Text) -> Text -> Boolean -> Vector.Vector File
list directory name_filter=Nothing recursive=False =
    new directory . list name_filter=name_filter recursive=recursive

    ## Creates a new output stream for this file and runs the specified action
       on it.

       Arguments:
       - open_options: A vector of `File.Option` objects determining how to open
         the stream. These options set the access properties of the stream.
       - action: A function that operates on the output stream and returns some

    ## Lists files contained in the directory denoted by this file.

       Arguments:
       - name_filter: A glob pattern that can be used to filter the returned
         files. If it is not specified, all files are returned.
       - recursive: Specifies whether the returned list of files should include
         also files from the subdirectories. If set to `False` (the default),
         only the immediate children of the listed directory are considered.

       The `name_filter` can contain the following special characters:
       - `"?"` - which matches a single filename character (so it will not match
         a `"/"`).
       - `"*"` - which matches any number of characters, but again does not
         cross directories.
       - `"**"` - which matches any number of characters and can cross
         directories.
       - `"\"` - can be used to escape the characters with special meaning; to
         get a single backslash, you need to specify it twice; you also need to
         keep in mind that the interpolating string literal also uses `"\"` as
         an escape sequence, so you need to type `'\\\\'` to get a single
         backslash for the glob pattern, unless you use the raw strings, where
         you only need to escape once: `"\\"`.
       - Brackets can be used to match exactly one character from some set of
         characters. For example `"[xy]"` matches `"x"` or `"y"`. Character
         ranges can also be specified: `"[a-z]"` matches any character from
         `"a"` to `"z"`. An exclamation mark can be used to negate the match,
         i.e. `"[!xz]"` will match any characters except for `"x"` and `"z"`.
         Moreover the ranges and single characters can be used together, so for
         example `"[a-cxy]"` will match `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"x"` or `"y"`.
         Within the brackets, the special characters `"*"`, `"?"` and `"\"`
         stand for themselves instead of their special meanings.
       - Braces allow to specify multiple patterns (separated with a comma), one
         of which must be matched. For example: `"{abc,x*}"` will match either
         the name `"abc"` or any name starting with `"x"`. The groups cannot be
         nested.

       Keep in mind that if `recursive` is set to True and a `name_filter` is
       used, the function will return files from subdirectories only if the set
       `name_filter` allows crossing directories. So even with `recursive=True`
       a filter `"*.txt"` will only return files that are immediate children of
       the listed directory, to list files recursively you need to use a filter
       like `"**.txt"` or `"*/*"` (which will match only files that are exactly
       one directory down from the listed directory) or no filter at all.

         List all files with ".md" or ".txt" extension in the example directory
         and any of its subdirectories.

   - on_existing_file: Specifies how to proceed if the file already exists.
   - on_problems: Specifies how to handle any encountered problems.

   If a character cannot be converted to a byte, an `Encoding_Error` is raised.
   If `on_problems` is set to `Report_Warning` or `Ignore`, it is replaced with
   a substitute (either � (if Unicode) or ? depending on the encoding).
   Otherwise, the process is aborted.

   that a `Byte` is between -128 and 127.
   If the path to the parent location cannot be found or the filename is
   invalid, a `File_Not_Found` is raised.
   If another error occurs, such as access denied, an `IO_Error` is raised.
   Otherwise, the file is created with the encoded text written to it.
