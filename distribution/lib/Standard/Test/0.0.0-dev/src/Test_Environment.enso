   Runs a given action with an environment variable modified to a given value.
   The environment variable is restored to its original value after the action.
   The environment variable override is only visible to the Enso
   `Environment.get` method, the environment as seen from a direct
   `System.getenv` Java call remains unchanged.

    ## This has to be done in Enso, not in Java, due to the bug: https://github.com/enso-org/enso/issues/7117
       If done in Java, Enso test functions do not work correctly, because they cannot access State.
