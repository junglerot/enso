## UNSTABLE

   Read an image from a file.

   The functon reads images in RGB format, or RGBA if the
   `Read_Alpha_Channel` flag is specified.

   Arguments:
   - location: the file to read.
   - flags: the read flags.

   > Example
     Read the image.
         Codecs.read "image.png"

   > Example
     Read the image with alpha channel.
         Codecs.read "image.png" Codecs.Read_Alpha_Channel

   > Example
     Read the image and convert it to grayscale.
         Codecs.read "image.png" Codecs.Read_Grayscale

## UNSTABLE

   Write an image to a file.

   Arguments:
   - location: The location to write the image to.
   - flags: A vector of flags that control how the image is written.

   > Example
     Write the image with applying png compression.
         Codecs.write path image

   > Example
     Write the image with applying png compression.
         Codecs.write path image (Codecs.Write_Png_Compression 9)

   > Example
     Write the image with applying several flags.
         Codecs.write path image [Codecs.Write_Jpeg_Quality 40, Codecs.Write_Jpeg_Progressive]

## UNSTABLE
type Read_Flag

    ## UNSTABLE

       Read the image with its alpha channel, otherwise the channel gets cropped.
    Read_Alpha_Channel

    ## UNSTABLE

       Always convert the image to a single channel grayscale image.
    Read_Grayscale

    ## UNSTABLE

       Use Geographic Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) driver to load images in
       geospatial raster data formats.
    Read_Gdal

## UNSTABLE
type Write_Flag

    ## UNSTABLE

       Sets the quality used when writing a JPEG.

       Arguments:
       - val: A quality value from 0 to 100 (the higher, the better).
    Write_Jpeg_Quality val=95

    ## UNSTABLE

       Enable progressive JPEG compression format. Disabled by default.
    Write_Jpeg_Progressive

    ## UNSTABLE

       Enable optimized JPEG encoding algorithms. Disabled by default.
    Write_Jpeg_Optimize

    ## UNSTABLE

       Sets the luma quality level used when writing a JPEG.

       Arguments:
       - val: A quality value from 0 to 100 (the higher, the better).
    Write_Jpeg_Luma_Quality val=0

    ## UNSTABLE

       Sets the chroma quality level used when writing a JPEG.

       Arguments:
       - val: A quality value from 0 to 100 (the higher, the better).
    Write_Jpeg_Chroma_Quality val=0

    ## UNSTABLE

       Sets the compression level used when writing a PNG.

       Arguments:
       - val: A compression level from 0 to 9. A higher value means a smaller
         size but a longer compression time.
    Write_Png_Compression val=3

    ## UNSTABLE

       Sets the quality used when writing a WEBP image.

       Arguments:
       - val: A quality from 0 to 100 (the higher, the better). A quality
         above 100 indicates that the encoder should use lossless compression.
    Write_Webp_Quality val=101

    ## PRIVATE
    value self = case self of
        Write_Jpeg_Progressive -> 1
        Write_Jpeg_Optimize -> 1
