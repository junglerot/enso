type Join_Condition
    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left_column` of the left table is equal to the
       element from the `right_column` of the right table.

       Missing values are treated as equal to each other.

       Arguments:
        - left_column: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right_column: A name or index of a column in the right table.
    Equals (left_column : Text | Integer) (right_column : Text | Integer)

    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left` column of the left table is equal to the
       element from the `right` column of the right table, ignoring case.

       Missing values are treated as equal to each other.

       This is only supported for text columns.

       Case insensitive comparisons may make it impossible for a database
       operation to re-use an existing index, which can possibly lead to
       performance degradation.

       Arguments:
        - left: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right: A name or index of a column in the right table. Defaults to the
          same column selector as provided for `left`.
        - locale: The locale to use for case insensitive comparisons.
    Equals_Ignore_Case (left : Text | Integer) (right : Text | Integer = left) (locale : Locale = Locale.default)

    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left` column of the left table fits between the
       corresponding elements from `right_lower` and `right_upper` columns of
       the right table. The comparison is inclusive.

       Pairs of rows in which any of `left`, `right_lower`, or `right_upper` is
       missing are ignored, as the comparison is assumed to be not well-defined
       for missing values.

       Arguments:
        - left: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right_lower: A name or index of a column in the right table, used as
          the lower bound for the check.
        - right_upper: A name or index of a column in the right table, used as
          the upper bound for the check.
    Between (left : Text | Integer) (right_lower : Text | Integer) (right_upper : Text | Integer)
