type Join_Condition
    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left_column` of the left table is equal to the
       element from the `right_column` of the right table.

       Arguments:
        - left_column: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right_column: A name or index of a column in the right table.
    Equals (left_column : Text | Integer) (right_column : Text | Integer)

    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left` column of the left table is equal to the
       element from the `right` column of the right table, ignoring case.

       This is only supported for text columns.

       Case insensitive comparisons may make it impossible for a database
       operation to re-use an existing index, which can possibly lead to
       performance degradation.

       Arguments:
        - left: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right: A name or index of a column in the right table.
    Equals_Ignore_Case (left : Text | Integer) (right : Text | Integer)

    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates rows from the two tables if
       the element from the `left` column of the left table fits between the
       corresponding elements from `right_lower` and `right_upper` columns of
       the right table. The comparison is inclusive.

       Arguments:
        - left: A name or index of a column in the left table.
        - right_lower: A name or index of a column in the right table, used as
          the lower bound for the check.
        - right_upper: A name or index of a column in the right table, used as
          the upper bound for the check.
    Between (left : Text | Integer) (right_lower : Text | Integer) (right_upper : Text | Integer)
