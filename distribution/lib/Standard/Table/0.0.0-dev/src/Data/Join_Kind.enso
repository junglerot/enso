type Join_Kind
    ## Returns only rows where a match between the left and right table is
       found. If one row from the left table matches multiple rows in the right
       table, it is duplicated this many times to be correlated with each
       matched row, and vice-versa.
    Inner

    ## Correlated rows are returned in the same way as with `Inner`, but each
       row from the left table that did not match any rows from the right one is
       also included - with columns of the right table being set to null for
       that row.
    Left_Outer

    ## Correlated rows are returned in the same way as with `Inner`, but each
       row from the right table that did not match any rows from the right one
       is also included - with columns of the right table being set to null for
       that row.
    Right_Outer

    ## Correlated rows are returned in the same way as with `Inner`, but each
       row from the left and right table that did not match any rows from the
       other one is also included - with columns of the other table being set to
       null for that row.
    Full

    ## Returns just rows of the left table that did not match any in the right
       table.

       In this mode, unlike in others, only columns of the left table are
       returned, since all columns of the right table would be all null anyway.
    Left_Exclusive

    ## Returns just rows of the right table that did not match any in the left
       table.

       In this mode, unlike in others, only columns of the right table are
       returned, since all columns of the left table would be all null anyway.
