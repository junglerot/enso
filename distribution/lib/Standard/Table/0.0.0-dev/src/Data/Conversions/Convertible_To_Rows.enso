from Standard.Base import all

## PRIVATE
   A special type that is used to define what types can be converted to a table
   as a sequence of rows, using `Table.from_objects`.

   It defines a `length` determining how many rows the table will have,
   and a `getter` function providing values for each row.

   To 'register' a type, a conversion `Convertible_To_Rows.from (that:Type)`
   must be defined.
type Convertible_To_Rows
    ## PRIVATE
       Arguments:
       - length: The number of rows in the table.
       - getter: Get the value for a specified row.
    Value length:Integer (getter : Integer->Any)

    ## PRIVATE
       Return the iterator values as a `Vector`.
    to_vector : Vector Any
    to_vector self = 0.up_to self.length . map self.getter

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:Vector = Convertible_To_Rows.Value that.length that.get

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:Array = Convertible_To_Rows.Value that.length that.get

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:List = Convertible_To_Rows.from that.to_vector

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:Range = Convertible_To_Rows.Value that.length that.get

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:Pair = Convertible_To_Rows.Value that.length that.get

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from that:Date_Range = Convertible_To_Rows.Value that.length that.get

## PRIVATE
Convertible_To_Rows.from (that:Any) =
    Convertible_To_Rows.Value 1 (n-> if n==0 then that else Nothing)
