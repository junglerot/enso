## Specifies a selection of columns from the table on which an operation is
   going to be performed.
type Column_Selector
    ## Selects columns based on their names.

       It can do regex-based and case insensitive matching if requested.
       It is possible for it to match multiple columns, in which case all the
       matched ones will be included in the same relative order as in the table.
    By_Name name:Text case_sensitivity:Case_Sensitivity=Case_Sensitivity.Insensitive use_regex:Boolean=False

    ## ALIAS dropna
       ALIAS drop_missing_columns
       Select columns which are either all blank or contain blank values.

       Arguments:
       - when_any: By default, only columns consisting of all blank cells are
         selected. If set to `True`, columns containing at least one blank value
         will be selected too. If there are no rows, the column is treated as
         blank regardless of this argument.
       - treat_nans_as_blank: If `True`, then `Number.nan` is considered as
         blank.

       ? Blank values
         Blank values are `Nothing`, `""` and depending on setting `Number.nan`.

       > Example
         Remove completely blank columns from a table.

             table.remove_columns Column_Selector.Blank_Columns
    Blank_Columns when_any:Boolean=False treat_nans_as_blank:Boolean=False
