## Specifies a selection of columns from the table on which an operation is
   going to be performed.
type Column_Selector

    ## Selects columns based on their names.

       The `matcher` can be used to specify if the names should be matched
       exactly or should be treated as regular expressions. It also allows to
       specify if the matching should be case-sensitive.
    By_Name (names : Vector Text) (matcher : Matcher = Text_Matcher_Data)

    ## Selects columns by their index.

       The index of the first column in the table is 0. If the provided index is
       negative, it counts from the end of the table (e.g. -1 refers to the last
       column in the table).
    By_Index (indexes : Vector Integer)

    ## Selects columns having exactly the same names as the columns provided in
       the input.

       The input columns do not necessarily have to come from the same table, so
       this approach can be used to match columns with the same names as a set
       of columns of some other table, for example, when preparing for a join.
    By_Column (columns : Vector Column)
