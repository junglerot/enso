type Unique_Name_Strategy
    ## PRIVATE
       Creates a Unique_Name_Strategy

       Arguments:
       - deduplicator: Name deduplicator
    Value deduplicator

       Creates a new Unique_Name_Strategy instance.

       This is a mutable data structure, that allows for creating a collection
       of columns names and making them unique. It will track any duplicates or
       invalid names that are passed to it.

       > Example
         Construct a set of unique names from two duplicate lists

             unique_name_strategy = Unique_Name_Strategy.new
             unique_names = ["A","B","A",""] . map unique_name_strategy.make_unique
             duplicates = unique_name_strategy.renames
             invalid = unique_name_strategy.invalid_names
    new : Unique_Name_Strategy
    new = Unique_Name_Strategy.Value NameDeduplicator.new

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Changes names from the second list so that they do not clash with names
       from the first list and with each other.

       It returns a new list where each new name corresponds to a name from the
       second list.

       It assumes that names on each list are unique within that list and that
       all of the provided names are already valid. The behavior is unspecified
       if they are not.

       The names are renamed using the following strategy:
       - if the name does not collide with any name from the first list, it will
         always be kept as-is,
       - if the name collides, we first append the provided prefix, if it is now
         unique (looking at the first list and the non-renamed elements of the
         second one), we return that,
       - if the name with the prefix still collides, we append a numeric suffix
         (starting with `_1`) to it, increasing the number as many times as
         necessary to get a name that will not collide.

       Note that non-renamed names from the second list have precedence over
       elements being renamed, even if they show up on the list later.

       > Example
         Rename names from a second list to avoid clashing with the first one.

             first = ["A", "B", "second_A"]
             second = ["A", "B", "second_A_1", "C"]
             unique_second = Unique_Name_Strategy.combine_with_prefix first second "second_"
             unique_second == ["second_A_2", "second_B", "second_A_1", "C"]
    combine_with_prefix : Vector Text -> Vector Text -> Text -> Unique_Name_Strategy
    combine_with_prefix self first second second_prefix =
        Vector.from_polyglot_array <|
            self.deduplicator.combineWithPrefix first second second_prefix

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Vector of any duplicates renamed.

       Note that this vector will not contain renames where just the
       second_prefix was added.
    renames : Vector
    renames self = Vector.from_polyglot_array self.deduplicator.getDuplicatedNames


    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Vector of any invalid names.
    invalid_names : Vector
    invalid_names self = Vector.from_polyglot_array self.deduplicator.getInvalidNames

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Takes a value and converts to a valid (but not necessarily unique) name.

       Arguments:
       - name: The column name to make valid.

       > Example
             strategy = Unique_Name_Strategy.new
             strategy.make_valid_name "" # returns "Column"
             strategy.make_valid_name 1 # returns "1"
             strategy.make_valid_name "Hello" # returns "Hello"
    make_valid_name : Any -> Text
    make_valid_name self input =
        case input of
            _ : Text -> self.deduplicator.makeValid input
            Nothing -> self.make_valid_name ""
            _ -> self.make_valid_name input.to_text

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Takes a name and gets a unique version.

       Arguments:
       - name: The column name to make unique.

       > Example
             strategy = Unique_Name_Strategy.new
             strategy.make_unique "A" # returns "A"
             strategy.make_unique "A" # returns "A_1"
    make_unique : Text -> Text
    make_unique self name = self.deduplicator.makeUnique name

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Tells if the given name has not yet been encountered.

       It does not use up the name - it needs to be marked with `mark_used` if
       needed.
    is_unique : Text -> Boolean
    is_unique self name = self.deduplicator.isUnique name

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Takes a list of names and gets a list of unique versions.

       Arguments:
       - names: The column names to make unique.
    make_all_unique : Vector Text -> Vector Text
    make_all_unique self names = names.map self.make_unique

    ## PRIVATE
       ADVANCED
       Takes a list of names and marks them as used, so that any further names
       clashing with those will have a prefix added.
    mark_used : Vector Text -> Nothing
    mark_used self names = names.each (self.deduplicator.markUsed _)
