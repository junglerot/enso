## PRIVATE
   A helper function encapsulating shared code for `select_columns`
   implementations of various Table variants. See the documentation for the
   Table type for details.

   It takes a list of columns and returns the selected columns. It is the
   responsibility of each implementation to reconstruct a proper table from the
   resulting list of columns.

   Arguments:
   - internal_columns: A list of all columns in a table.
   - selector: Column selection criteria.
   - reorder: Specifies whether to reorder the matched columns according to the
     order of the selection criteria.
     If `False`, the matched entries are returned in the same order as in the
     input.
     If `True`, the matched entries are returned in the order of the criteria
     matching them. If a single object has been matched by multiple criteria, it
     is placed in the group belonging to the first matching criterion on the
     list. If a single criterion's group has more than one element, their
     relative order is the same as in the input.
   - on_problems: Specifies the behavior when a problem occurs during the
     operation. By default, a warning is issued, but the operation proceeds.
     If set to `Report_Error`, the operation fails with a dataflow error.
     If set to `Ignore`, the operation proceeds without errors or warnings.
   - warnings: A Warning_System instance specifying how to handle warnings. This
     is a temporary workaround to allow for testing the warning mechanism. Once
     the proper warning system is implemented, this argument will become
     obsolete and will be removed. No user code should use this argument, as it
     will be removed in the future.

   bounds.
