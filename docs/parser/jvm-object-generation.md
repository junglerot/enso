# JVM Object Generation

The JVM object generation phase is responsible for creating JVM-native objects
representing the parser AST from the rust-native AST. This is required to allow
the compiler and runtime to work with the AST.

# Overall Architecture

The JVM foreign function interface (FFI), named
[Java Native Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface)
(JNI), enables the Rust parser library to call and be called by the parser
library implemented in Scala.

Specifically, in our architecture, the JNI is used for:

- Invoking Rust parser methods from Scala.
- Invoking Scala AST constructors from Rust.
