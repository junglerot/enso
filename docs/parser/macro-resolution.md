# Macro Resolution

Macro resolution is the process of taking the structured token stream from the
[lexer](./lexer.md), and resolving it into the [ast](./ast.md) through the
process of resolving macros. This process produces a chunked AST stream,
including spacing-unaware elements.

## Functionality

The current functionality of the macro resolver is as follows:

- TBC

The current overview of the macro resolution process can be found in the scala
[implementation](../../lib/syntax/specialization/shared/src/main/scala/org/enso/syntax/text/Parser.scala).

## Errors During Macro Resolution

It is very important that, during macro resolution, the resolver produces
descriptive errors for error conditions in the macro resolver.
