# Source File Encoding
While many modern programming languages are moving in a direction of being
liberal with the input they accept, we find that this often leads to the
resultant code being more difficult to use.

This file describes the source file encoding for Enso files.

## Source Encoding
All input source in Enso is UTF-8 encoded.

## Indentation
Indentation in Enso is performed using spaces. An indent level is 4 spaces.

This is intentionally not made configurable.
