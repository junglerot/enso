# Diagnostics
Due to the highly interactive and always-online nature of a running Enso
program, it is very important that compile diagnostics (such as lints, errors,
and warnings) are surfaced in the _running_ language. This is particularly 
important for visual mode.

To this end, Enso provides mechanisms by which diagnostics are scoped to the
smallest possible program component, and are even translated into executable
nodes in the interpreter so that they can be interacted with at runtime.
