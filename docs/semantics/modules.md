# Modules

Modules are the basic way to organize code into smaller, semantically-relevant
parts. The following is the description of the semantics of Enso modules.

## Introduction

There's a one-to-one correspondence between source files and modules. Moreover,
a module's name is the same as that of the corresponding source file. That also
implies, that an Enso source file name must be a valid referent name. Modules
are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables and passed as
function parameters.

## Referring to Modules

Modules can be imported into the current scope by using the `import` statement.
To import a module, one must provide it's full qualified path. A qualified path
of a module is a number of `.`-separated segments, where:

1. The first segment is the name of the project in which the module is located.
2. The following segments are the names of directories between `src` and the
   source file being imported.
3. The last segment is the name of the source file, with the `.enso` extension
   stripped.

For example, a qualified name of a module corresponding to the file
`src/Foo/Bar/Baz.enso` in project `Project` is `Project.Foo.Bar.Baz`.

Whenever a module is imported, its name (either the last segment of the
qualified name or the name it was renamed to), becomes available in the
importing scope as a value.

Moreover, the current module is always visible in the scope under its file-based
name, and as the special variable `here`.

## Module-Level Methods

A method defined without an explicit `this` reference, or with `this` explicitly
set to the current module, becomes a module-level method. Such a method can be
called by passing the module as the `this` parameter. Such methods can also be
called by importing modules and using the imported module in place of `this`.

## Types

From the perspective of accessing them through imports, there is no difference
between a `type` constructor definition and a module-level method. Both can be
accessed in exactly the same ways both from inside the module and from the
importing modules.

## Referent Name Resolution

Referent names are resolved in a special way, by finding the relevant name among
imported modules and items explicitely imported from them. Imported items may be
one of the following: modules, types, module-level methods and polyglot symbols.

The order of resolving names is as follows:

1. Symbols defined in local (function or block) scopes.
2. Symbols defined in the current module.
3. Names of imported modules.
4. Names explicitly imported from modules.

If there's an ambiguity at any level, an error is reported.

## Referent Names in Method Calls

If a referent name is used as the method name in method call syntax, it is not
subject to referent name resolution and is instead treated as though it was not
referent in this position.

## Importing & Exporting Methods

Methods defined both on the module and on other types are always imported and
exported automatically whenever the module is imported or exported. There is
currently no plan to allow hiding methods from imported / re-exported modules,
but this decision will be revised after a sufficiently large corpus of Enso code
exists.

## Export Statement Semantics

A qualified export statement only exports the name of the exported module
(possibly renamed).

In a `from` export, any mentioned items become available as though they were
defined in the exporting module.

Please note it is explicitly forbidden for export statements across modules
to form a cycle. If export statements cycle is detected, a compile error will
be reported.

## Project Main Module

The module `Main` in any project is treated specially, as the main entry-point
to the library. Therefore, using the bare project name in an import statement
(e.g. `import My_Project`) is equivalent to importing the `Main` module with the
proper rename (e.g. `import My_Project.Main as My_Project`). This syntax sugar
works with any kind of import or export statement.
