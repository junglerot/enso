# Scoping Rules
Enso's scoping rules should be fairly familiar to those coming from other
languages that are immutable (or make heavy use of immutability). In essence,
Enso is a lexically-scoped language where bindings may be shadowed in child
scopes.

## Scopes
A scope is the span in the code within which a set of accessible identifiers
occurs. A nested scope may:

- Reference identifiers defined in parent scopes.
- Shadow identifiers from parent scopes with a new binding.
- Ascribing a type identifier to a binding outside the current scope.

Identifier visibility behaves as follows:

- Identifiers are bound by using a variable name in a pattern context (e.g. the
  LHS of a binding, a function argument, or a case expression pattern).
- Identifiers are accessible only _after_ they have been defined.
- Identifiers introduced into a given scope `s` are accessible in `s` and all
  the children of `s`, _after_ the point at which they are introduced.
- If a scope uses an identifier defined in an outer scope, and then later (in
  the thread of execution) shadows that variable, any usage before the shadowing
  point refers to the occurrence in the outer scope.

The term _accessible_ is defined to mean "can be referred to in the code as a
valid entity," and hence implies "can have its value used."

## Introducing New Scopes
The following constructs introduce new scopes in Enso:

- **Modules:** Each module (file) introduces a new scope.
- **The Function Arrow `(->)`:** The arrow operator introduces a new scope that
  is shared by both of its operands. This is true both when it is used for a
  lambda (value or type), and when used to denote case branches.
- **Code Blocks:** A code block introduces a new scope.
- **The Type Ascription Operator:** The type ascription operator introduces a
  new scope on its right hand side.

A new scope is _always_ introduced as a child of the scope in which the
introducing construct occurs, unless explicitly noted otherwise.

There are other linguistic constructs that _behave_ as if they introduce a
scope, but this is purely down to the fact that they desugar to one or more of
the above constructs:

- **Method Definitions:** A method definition introduces a new scope. This is
  simply because the method definition desugars to a lambda definition.
- **Function Definitions:** A function definition introduces a new scope. This
  is simply because the method definition desugars to a lambda definition.

>   of a module, and are currently unsupported.

>   implementation of `case` evolves.

### Scoping of Type Signatures
Currently, type signatures in Enso obey a simple set of typing rules:

- The RHS of the type ascription introduces a new scope that is a child of the
  scope in which the LHS of the type ascription exists.

## Implementation Notes
This section contains notes on the implementation of the Enso scoping rules in
the interpreter.

### Function Call Arguments
In order to support suspended function arguments in the interpreter in a
performant way, we implicitly wrap _all_ function arguments in a suspension. In
conjunction with making the function itself responsible for when its arguments
are evaluated, this lets us have incredibly performant suspended computations in
Enso.

However, it _does_ require creating a small hack in the Alias Analysis process:

- In order for an expression to be a suspension, it must occur in its own scope
  (the suspended scope).
- Alias analysis must account for this, otherwise the code generator will get
  frame accesses incorrect.

To this end, we account for this implementation detail in alias analysis.

### Collapsing Scopes
Another quirk of the internal alias analysis process is down to the fact that
the Enso IR represents Methods, functions, and blocks as separate constructs.
This means that if you had a method containing a function containing a block, a
naive implementation of alias analysis would allocate three scopes here.

This is incorrect, according to the semantic specification of the language, so
the alias analysis process needs to handle the collapsing of these scopes as it
allocates them. The rules are as follows:

- If you have a method whose body is a function, they share a scope.
- If you have a function whose body is a block, they share a scope.
