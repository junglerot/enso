# Enso's Semantics

Much like we have specifications for the [syntax](../syntax/README.md) and the
[type system](../types/README.md) in Enso, we also need a specification of the
language semantics. These documents specify the executable semantics of the Enso
language.

> The actionables for this section are:
>
> - As we make more semantic determinations about the language these should be
>   written down here.

This specification is broken down into the following sections:

- [**Bindings:**](./bindings.md) The semantics of Enso's binding expressions.
- [**Diagnostics:**](./diagnostics.md) The semantics of Enso's executable
  compiler diagnostics.
- [**Dispatch:**](./dispatch.md) The semantics of Enso's dispatch system.
- [**Errors:**](./errors.md) The semantics of Enso's various error systems.
- [**Evaluation:**](./evaluation.md) Enso's evaluation semantics, including
  those of suspended computations.
- [**Modules:**](./modules.md) The semantics of Enso's modules.
- [**Scoping:**](./scoping.md) Enso's scoping and identifier resolution rules.
