# Enso Distribution
Documents in this section deal with the process of packaging both Enso and its
dependencies, and Enso projects for use by our users.

  to our users, and for use by the [IDE](https://github.com/enso-org/ide).
- [**Packaging:**](./packaging.md) Information on the structure of an Enso
  project/package.
