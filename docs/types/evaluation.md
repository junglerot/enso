# Evaluation and Typing

Enso is a language that has strict semantics by default, but it can still be
very useful to be able to opt-in to suspended computations (thunks) for the
design of certain APIs.

To that end, Enso provides a mechanism for this through the type system. The
standard library defines a `Suspend a` type which, when used in explicit type
signatures, will cause the corresponding expression to be suspended.

- The explicit calls to `Suspend` and `force` are inserted automatically by the
  compiler doing demand analysis.
- This demand analysis process will also ensure that there are not polynomial
  chains of suspend and force being inserted to ensure performance.
