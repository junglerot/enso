# Monadic Contexts

Coming from a Haskell background, we have found that Monads provide a great
abstraction with which to reason about program behaviour, but they have some
severe usability issues. The main one of these is the lack of automatic lifting,
requiring users to explicitly lift computations through their monad transformer
stack.

For a language as focused on usability as Enso is this really isn't feasible. To
that end, we have created the notion of a 'Monadic Context', which is a monad
transformer based on Supermonads (see
[references](./references.md#monadic-contexts)). These have special support in
the compiler, and hence can be automatically lifted to aid usability.

## Context Syntax

There are three main notes about the syntax of contexts:

1. Monadic contexts are defined using the `in` keyword (e.g. `Int in IO`).
2. We have a symbol `!`, which is short-hand for putting something into the
   `Exception` monadic context. This is related to broken values.
3. Contexts can be combined by using the standard typeset operators, or nested
   through repeated uses of `in`.

## Monadic Bind

It is also important to note that Enso has no equivalent to `<-` in Haskell.
Instead, pure computations are implicitly placed in the `Pure` monadic context,
and `=` acts to 'peel off' the outermost layer of contexts. As such, this means
that `=` _always_ acts as `bind`, greatly simplifying how the type-checker has
to work.

## Context Definitions

Contexts can be defined by users.

## Context Lifting

> - It depends on the order of `runCtx`

## Inbuilt Contexts

Enso includes a set of commonly-used monadic contexts as part of `Base`, its
standard library. These are listed below.

### IO

> The actionables for this section are:
>
> - Determine the granularity of IO (it's not one context, but a lot).
> - Explain how there is no `runIO`, and IO is just run at the program boundary,
>   as well as the impacts of this.

### State

> The actionables for this section are:
>
> - Determine exactly how state works (the fact that the 'keys' are preset by
>   the `runState`)
> - Describe how dependently-typed maps allow us to provide more flexible
>   interfaces in future.
