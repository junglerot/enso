# Enso Developer Documentation
This folder contains the documentation for the implementation of the Enso
programming language. The documentation is broken up by subject, within the
below-listed categories, and each subject combines information about the
design, specification, and implementation of the feature to which it pertains.

We provide a number of useful resources for getting a quick understanding of
the Enso project:

- [**The Enso Philosophy:**](./enso-philosophy.md) Information on the design 
  philosophy behind Enso, and why we build things in the way we do.
- [**Contributing Guidelines:**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) Information for people
  wanting to contribute to Enso (in many different ways).
- [**Community Code of Conduct:**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) The code of conduct for
  members of our community, developers and users alike.
- [**Security Guidelines:**](./SECURITY.md) Security guidelines for the Enso
  project, including supported versions and our vulnerability reporting process.
- [**Getting Enso](./getting-enso.md) Instructions for how to get and run
  a copy of Enso.

It is broken up into categories as follows:

- [**Distribution:**](./distirbution) Information on how we distribute Enso to
  our users, and how Enso packages themselves work.
- [**Language Server:**](./language-server) Information on the Enso language
  server, its protocol, and how it integrates with the runtime.
