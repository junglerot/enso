/**
 * The ProblemAggregator is the main way for reporting warnings from helper Java code to Enso.
 *
 * <p>The Enso user should always use the `Java_Problems.with_problem_aggregator` helper to get an
 * instance of ProblemAggregator and pass it to any Java code that requires it.
 *
 * <p>Child instances of the aggregator can be constructed via various means. They can be used to
 * detach various warnings in case a branch of the computation fails, or to add specialized logic
 * for aggregating various kinds of problems, or to provide additional context information to be
 * attached to the aggregated problems (e.g. {@link ColumnAggregatedProblemAggregator}).
 *
 * <p>We ensure that no problems are 'dropped' by requiring every method reporting problems to take
 * an instance of the ProblemAggregator. The ProblemAggregators create a hierarchy of child
 * aggregators that ensures all problems are passed upwards, up to the top-level aggregator created
 * in `with_problem_aggregator`. Thus, no problems are discarded.
 *
 * <p>The only thing the user has to be careful about is the lifetime of the aggregators. Once we
 * exit the `with_problem_aggregator` section, the aggregator is summarized and any reported
 * problems are reported in Enso. After that, no new problems can be reported, because they would be
 * lost. This is verified by the `checkNotFinished` method - if the user ever uses an aggregator
 * after summarizing, such code will throw an exception. In general, the `with_problem_aggregator`
 * section should encompass the whole chunk of operation that is being performed, to ensure that all
 * processing that may report problems to the aggregator is finished before we exit the section.
