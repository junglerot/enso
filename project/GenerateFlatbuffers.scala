   * command succeeded).
   *
   * To avoid complex process handling logic, upon detecting an error,
   * flatc is re-run giving it a chance to print the errors.
   *
   * The errors are printed when gathering source files, so when flatc is re-run
   * afterwards for actual code generation, no new errors should show up, so in
   * this case the error reporting logic is skipped.
   * In case an error did show up, an exception will be thrown (but this could
   * only happen if the file has been edited during compilation).

    * sure to remove any potential duplicates before returning the list of
    * generated sources.
