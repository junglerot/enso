Reads the release metadata at PATH (in JSON format) and checks if it contains
the broken mark. Exit code 0 indicates that the release contains the broken
mark. Other exit codes mean that the release either could not be loaded or is
not marked broken. If the release is marked as broken, it also prints the URL to
download the broken mark file.`;
